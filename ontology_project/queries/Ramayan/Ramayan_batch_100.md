### Verse 1 (Ramayana 0.26)
- **Original**: 8 The Ramayana The Vedas18and their kindred lore. Well skilled is he the bow to draw,19 Well trained in arts and versed in law; High-souled and meet for happy fate, Most tender and compassionate; The noblest of all lordly givers, Whom good men follow, as the rivers Follow the King of Floods, the sea: So liberal, so just is he. 18 “Veda means originally knowing or knowledge, and this name is given by the Bráhmans not to one work, but to the whole body of their most ancient sacred literature. Veda is the same word which appears in the Greek¿w´±, I know, and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The name of Veda is commonly given to four collections of hymns, which are respectively known by the names of Rig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sáma-veda, and Atharva-veda.” “As the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit, is the most ancient type of the English of the present day, (Sanskrit and English are but varieties of one and the same language,) so its thoughts and feelings contain in reality the first roots and germs of that intellectual growth which by an unbroken chain connects our own generation with the ancestors of the Aryan race,— with those very people who at the rising and setting of the sun listened with trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda, that told them of bright powers above, and of a life to come after the sun of their own lives had set in the clouds of the evening. These men were the true ancestors of our race, and the Veda is the oldest book we have in which to study the first beginnings of our language, and of all that is embodied in language. We are by nature Aryan, Indo-European, not Semitic: our spiritual kith and kin are to be found in India, Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Palestine.” Chips from a German Workshop, Vol. I. pp. 8. 4. 19 As with the ancient Persians and Scythians, Indian princes were carefully

- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 9 The joy of Queen Kau[alyá's20heart, In every virtue he has part: Firm as Himálaya's21 snowy steep, Unfathomed like the mighty deep: The peer of VishGu's power and might, And lovely as the Lord of Night;22 Patient as Earth, but, roused to ire, Fierce as the world-destroying fire; In bounty like the Lord of Gold,23 And Justice self in human mould. With him, his best and eldest son, By all his princely virtues won King Da[aratha24 willed to share His kingdom as the Regent Heir. But when Kaikeyí, youngest queen, With eyes of envious hate had seen The solemn pomp and regal state Prepared the prince to consecrate, She bade the hapless king bestow Two gifts he promised long ago, That Ráma to the woods should flee, And that her child the heir should be. By chains of duty firmly tied, The wretched king perforce complied. [004] instructed in archery which stands for military science in general, of which, among Hindu heroes, it was the most important branch. 20 Chief of the three queens of Da[aratha and mother of Ráma. 21 From hima snow, (GreekÇµ¹¼-}½, Latin hiems) andálaya abode, the Mansion of snow. 22 The moon (Soma ,Indu,Chandra etc.) is masculine with the Indians as with the Germans. 23 Kuvera, the Indian Plutus, or God of Wealth. 24 The events here briefly mentioned will be related fully in the course of the poem. The first four cantos are introductory, and are evidently the work of a later hand than Valmiki's.

### Verse 3 (Ramayana 0.28)
- **Original**: 10 The Ramayana Ráma, to please Kaikeyí went Obedient forth to banishment. Then LakshmaG's truth was nobly shown, Then were his love and courage known, When for his brother's sake he dared All perils, and his exile shared. And Sítá, Ráma's darling wife, Loved even as he loved his life, Whom happy marks combined to bless, A miracle of loveliness, Of Janak's royal lineage sprung, Most excellent of women, clung To her dear lord, like RohiGí Rejoicing with the Moon to be.25 The King and people, sad of mood, The hero's car awhile pursued. But when Prince Ráma lighted down At Zringavera's pleasant town, Where Gangá's holy waters flow, 25 “Chandra, or the Moon, is fabled to have been married to the twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch Daksha, or A[viní and the rest, who are in fact personifications of the Lunar Asterisms. His favourite amongst them was RohiGí to whom he so wholly devoted himself as to neglect the rest. They complained to their father, and Daksha repeatedly interposed, till, finding his remonstrances vain, he denounced a curse upon his son-in-law, in consequence of which he remained childless and became affected by consumption. The wives of Chandra having interceded in his behalf with their father, Daksha modified an imprecation which he could not recall, and pronounced that the decay should be periodical only, not permanent, and that it should alternate with periods of recovery. Hence the successive wane and increase of the Moon. Padma ,PuráGa,Swarga-KhaG a,Sec.

### Verse 4 (Ramayana 0.29)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 11 He bade his driver turn and go. Guha, Nishádas' king, he met, And on the farther bank was set. Then on from wood to wood they strayed, O'er many a stream, through constant shade, As Bharadvája bade them, till They came to Chitrakúma's hill. And Ráma there, with LakshmaG's aid, A pleasant little cottage made, And spent his days with Sítá, dressed In coat of bark and deerskin vest.26 And Chitrakúma grew to be As bright with those illustrious three As Meru's27 sacred peaks that shine With glory, when the Gods recline Beneath them:Ziva's28 self between The Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen. 26 The garb prescribed for ascetics by Manu. 27 “Mount Meru, situated like Kailása in the lofty regions to the north of the Himálayas, is celebrated in the traditions and myths of India. Meru and Kailása are the two Indian Olympi. Perhaps they were held in such veneration be- cause the Sanskrit-speaking Indians remembered the ancient home where they dwelt with the other primitive peoples of their family before they descended to occupy the vast plains which extend between the Indus and the Ganges.” G ORRESIO {FNS . 28 The third God of the Indian Triad, the God of destruction and reproduction.

### Verse 5 (Ramayana 0.30)
- **Original**: 12 The Ramayana The aged king for Ráma pined, And for the skies the earth resigned. Bharat, his son, refused to reign, Though urged by all the twice-born29 train. Forth to the woods he fared to meet His brother, fell before his feet, And cried,“Thy claim all men allow: O come, our lord and king be thou.” But Ráma nobly chose to be Observant of his sire's decree. He placed his sandals30 in his hand A pledge that he would rule the land: And bade his brother turn again. Then Bharat, finding prayer was vain, The sandals took and went away; Nor in Ayodhyá would he stay. But turned to Nandigráma, where He ruled the realm with watchful care, Still longing eagerly to learn Tidings of Ráma's safe return. Then lest the people should repeat Their visit to his calm retreat, Away from Chitrakúma's hill Fared Ráma ever onward till[005] 29 The epithetdwija, ortwice-born, is usually appropriate to Bráhmans, but is applicable to the three higher castes. Investiture with the sacred thread and initiation of the neophyte into certain religious mysteries are regarded as his regeneration or second birth. 30 His shoes to be a memorial of the absent heir and to maintain his right.

### Verse 6 (Ramayana 0.31)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 13 Beneath the shady trees he stood Of DaG aká's primeval wood, Virádha, giant fiend, he slew, And then Agastya's friendship knew. Counselled by him he gained the sword And bow of Indra, heavenly lord: A pair of quivers too, that bore Of arrows an exhaustless store. While there he dwelt in greenwood shade The trembling hermits sought his aid, And bade him with his sword and bow Destroy the fiends who worked them woe: To come like Indra strong and brave, A guardian God to help and save. And Ráma's falchion left its trace Deep cut onZúrpaGakhá's face: A hideous giantess who came Burning for him with lawless flame. Their sister's cries the giants heard. And vengeance in each bosom stirred: The monster of the triple head. And DúshaG to the contest sped. But they and myriad fiends beside Beneath the might of Ráma died. When Ráva G, dreaded warrior, knew The slaughter of his giant crew: RávaG, the king, whose name of fear Earth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear: He bade the fiend Márícha aid The vengeful plot his fury laid. In vain the wise Márícha tried To turn him from his course aside: Not RávaG's self, he said, might hope

### Verse 7 (Ramayana 0.32)
- **Original**: 14 The Ramayana With Ráma and his strength to cope. Impelled by fate and blind with rage He came to Ráma's hermitage. There, by Márícha's magic art, He wiled the princely youths apart, The vulture31 slew, and bore away The wife of Ráma as his prey. The son of Raghu32 came and found Jamáyu slain upon the ground. He rushed within his leafy cot; He sought his wife, but found her not. Then, then the hero's senses failed; In mad despair he wept and wailed. Upon the pile that bird he laid, And still in quest of Sítá strayed. A hideous giant then he saw, Kabandha named, a shape of awe. The monstrous fiend he smote and slew, And in the flame the body threw; When straight from out the funeral flame In lovely form Kabandha came, And bade him seek in his distress A wise and holy hermitess. By counsel of this saintly dame To Pampá's pleasant flood he came, And there the steadfast friendship won Of Hanumán the Wind-God's son. Counselled by him he told his grief 31 Jamáyu, a semi-divine bird, the friend of Ráma, who fought in defence of Sítá. 32 Raghu was one of the most celebrated ancestors of Ráma whose commonest appellation is, therefore, Rághava or descendant of Raghu. Kálidása in the RaghuraG[a makes him the son of Dilípa and great-grandfather of Ráma. See Idylls from the Sanskrit,“Aja” and “Dilípa.”

### Verse 8 (Ramayana 0.33)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 15 To great Sugríva, Vánar chief, Who, knowing all the tale, before The sacred flame alliance swore. Sugríva to his new-found friend Told his own story to the end: His hate of Báli for the wrong And insult he had borne so long. And Ráma lent a willing ear And promised to allay his fear. Sugríva warned him of the might Of Báli, matchless in the fight, And, credence for his tale to gain, Showed the huge fiend33 by Báli slain. The prostrate corse of mountain size Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes; He lightly kicked it, as it lay, And cast it twenty leagues34 away. To prove his might his arrows through Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew. He cleft a mighty hill apart, And down to hell he hurled his dart. Then high Sugríva's spirit rose, Assured of conquest o'er his foes. With his new champion by his side To vast Kishkindhá's cave he hied. Then, summoned by his awful shout, King Báli came in fury out, First comforted his trembling wife, Then sought Sugríva in the strife. One shaft from Ráma's deadly bow The monarch in the dust laid low. 33 Dundhubi. 34 Literallyten yojanas.

### Verse 9 (Ramayana 0.34)
- **Original**: 16 The Ramayana Then Ráma bade Sugríva reign In place of royal Báli slain. Then speedy envoys hurried forth Eastward and westward, south and north, Commanded by the grateful king Tidings of Ráma's spouse to bring. Then by Sampáti's counsel led, Brave Hanumán, who mocked at dread, Sprang at one wild tremendous leap Two hundred leagues across the deep. To Lanká's35 town he urged his way, Where RávaG held his royal sway.[006] There pensive 'neath A[oka36 boughs He found poor Sítá, Ráma's spouse. He gave the hapless girl a ring, A token from her lord and king. A pledge from her fair hand he bore; Then battered down the garden door. Five captains of the host he slew, Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew; Crushed youthful Aksha on the field, Then to his captors chose to yield. Soon from their bonds his limbs were free, But honouring the high decree Which Brahmá37 had pronounced of yore, 35 Ceylon. 36 The Jonesia A[oka is a most beautiful tree bearing a profusion of red blossoms. 37 Brahmá , the Creator, is usually regarded as the first God of the Indian Trinity, although, as Kálidása says: “Of Brahmá, VishGu,Ziva, each may be First, second, third, amid the blessed Three.” Brahmá had guaranteed RávaG's life against all enemies except man.

### Verse 10 (Ramayana 0.35)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 17 He calmly all their insults bore. The town he burnt with hostile flame, And spoke again with Ráma's dame, Then swiftly back to Ráma flew With tidings of the interview. Then with Sugríva for his guide, Came Ráma to the ocean side. He smote the sea with shafts as bright As sunbeams in their summer height, And quick appeared the Rivers' King38 Obedient to the summoning. A bridge was thrown by Nala o'er The narrow sea from shore to shore.39 They crossed to Lanká's golden town, Where Ráma's hand smote RávaG down. VibhishaG there was left to reign Over his brother's wide domain. To meet her husband Sítá came; But Ráma, stung with ire and shame, With bitter words his wife addressed Before the crowd that round her pressed. But Sítá, touched with noble ire, Gave her fair body to the fire. Then straight the God of Wind appeared, And words from heaven her honour cleared. And Ráma clasped his wife again, Uninjured, pure from spot and stain, Obedient to the Lord of Fire And the high mandate of his sire. Led by the Lord who rules the sky, 38 Ocean personified. 39 The rocks lying between Ceylon and the mainland are still called Ráma's Bridge by the Hindus.

### Verse 11 (Ramayana 0.36)
- **Original**: 18 The Ramayana The Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh, And honoured him with worthy meed, Rejoicing in each glorious deed. His task achieved, his foe removed, He triumphed, by the Gods approved. By grace of Heaven he raised to life The chieftains slain in mortal strife; Then in the magic chariot through The clouds to Nandigráma flew. Met by his faithful brothers there, He loosed his votive coil of hair: Thence fair Ayodhyá's town he gained, And o'er his father's kingdom reigned. Disease or famine ne'er oppressed His happy people, richly blest With all the joys of ample wealth, Of sweet content and perfect health. No widow mourned her well-loved mate, No sire his son's untimely fate. They feared not storm or robber's hand; No fire or flood laid waste the land: The Golden Age40 had come again To bless the days of Ráma's reign. From him, the great and glorious king, Shall many a princely scion spring. And he shall rule, beloved by men, 40 “The Bráhmans, with a system rather cosmogonical than chronological, divide the present mundane period into four ages oryugas as they call them: the Krita, the Tretá, the Dwápara, and the Kali. The Krita, called also the Deva-yuga or that of the Gods, is the age of truth, the perfect age, the Tretá is the age of the three sacred fires, domestic and sacrificial; the Dwápara is the age of doubt; the Kali, the present age, is the age of evil.” G ORRESIO .{FNS

### Verse 13 (Ramayana 0.38)
- **Original**: 20 The Ramayana Válmíki, graceful speaker, heard, To highest admiration stirred. To him whose fame the tale rehearsed He paid his mental worship first; Then with his pupil humbly bent Before the saint most eloquent. Thus honoured and dismissed the seer Departed to his heavenly sphere. Then from his cot Válmíki hied To Tamasá's44 sequestered side, Not far remote from Gangá's tide. He stood and saw the ripples roll Pellucid o'er a pebbly shoal. To Bharadvája45 by his side He turned in ecstasy, and cried: “See, pupil dear, this lovely sight, The smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright, With not a speck or shade to mar, And clear as good men's bosoms are. Here on the brink thy pitcher lay, And bring my zone of bark, I pray. Here will I bathe: the rill has not, To lave the limbs, a fairer spot. Do quickly as I bid, nor waste The precious time; away, and haste.” 44 There are several rivers in India of this name, now corrupted intoTonse. The river here spoken of is that which falls into the Ganges a little below Allahabad. 45 “In Book II, Canto LIV, we meet with a saint of this name presiding over a convent of disciples in his hermitage at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna. Thence the later author of these introductory cantos has borrowed the name and person, inconsistently indeed, but with the intention of enhancing the dignity of the poet by ascribing to him so celebrated a disciple.” SCHLEGEL .{FNS

Brahmá's Visit 21 Obedient to his master's hest Quick from the cot he brought the vest; The hermit took it from his hand, And tightened round his waist the band; Then duly dipped and bathed him there, And muttered low his secret prayer. To spirits and to Gods he made Libation of the stream, and strayed Viewing the forest deep and wide That spread its shade on every side. Close by the bank he saw a pair Of curlews sporting fearless there. But suddenly with evil mind An outcast fowler stole behind, And, with an aim too sure and true, The male bird near the hermit slew. The wretched hen in wild despair With fluttering pinions beat the air, And shrieked a long and bitter cry When low on earth she saw him lie, Her loved companion, quivering, dead, His dear wings with his lifeblood red; And for her golden crested mate She mourned, and was disconsolate. The hermit saw the slaughtered bird, And all his heart with ruth was stirred. The fowler's impious deed distressed His gentle sympathetic breast, And while the curlew's sad cries rang Within his ears, the hermit sang: “No fame be thine for endless time, Because, base outcast, of thy crime, Whose cruel hand was fain to slay

### Verse 15 (Ramayana 0.40)
- **Original**: 22 The Ramayana One of this gentle pair at play!” E'en as he spoke his bosom wrought And laboured with the wondering thought What was the speech his ready tongue Had uttered when his heart was wrung. He pondered long upon the speech, Recalled the words and measured each, And thus exclaimed the saintly guide To Bharadvája by his side: “With equal lines of even feet, With rhythm and time and tone complete, The measured form of words I spoke In shock of grief be termed a[loke.”46 And Bharadvája, nothing slow His faithful love and zeal to show, Answered those words of wisdom,“Be The name, my lord, as pleases thee.” As rules prescribe the hermit took Some lustral water from the brook. But still on this his constant thought Kept brooding, as his home he sought; While Bharadvája paced behind, A pupil sage of lowly mind, And in his hand a pitcher bore With pure fresh water brimming o'er. Soon as they reached their calm retreat The holy hermit took his seat; His mind from worldly cares recalled, And mused in deepest thought enthralled. 46 The poet plays upon the similarity in sound of the two words:[oka, means grief,[loka, the heroic measure in which the poem is composed. It need scarcely be said that the derivation is fanciful.

### Verse 16 (Ramayana 0.41)
- **Original**: Canto II. Brahmá's Visit 23 Then glorious Brahmá,47 Lord Most High, Creator of the earth and sky, [008] The four-faced God, to meet the sage Came to Válmíki's hermitage. Soon as the mighty God he saw, Up sprang the saint in wondering awe. Mute, with clasped hands, his head he bent, And stood before him reverent. His honoured guest he greeted well, Who bade him of his welfare tell; Gave water for his blessed feet, Brought offerings,48 and prepared a seat. In honoured place the God Most High Sate down, and bade the saint sit nigh. There sate before Válmíki's eyes The Father of the earth and skies; But still the hermit's thoughts were bent On one thing only, all intent On that poor curlew's mournful fate Lamenting for her slaughtered mate; And still his lips, in absent mood, The verse that told his grief, renewed: 47 Brahmá, the Creator, is usually regarded as the first person of the divine triad of India. The four heads with which he is represented are supposed to have allusion to the four corners of the earth which he is sometimes considered to personify. As an object of adoration Brahmá has been entirely superseded by Ziva and VishGu. In the whole of India there is, I believe, but one temple dedicated to his worship. In this point the first of the Indian triad curiously resembles the last of the divine fraternity of Greece, Aïdes the brother of Zeus and Poseidon.“In all Greece, says Pausanias, there is no single temple of Aïdes, except at a single spot in Elis.” See Gladstone's Juventus Mundi, p. 253. 48 The argha or arghya was a libation or offering to a deity, a Bráhman, or other venerable personage. According to one authority it consisted of water, milk, the points of Kúsa-grass, curds, clarified butter, rice, barley, and white mustard, according to another, of saffron, bel, unbroken grain, flowers, curds, dúrbá-grass, kúsa-grass, and sesamum.

Seek not to trace, with labour vain, The unpremeditated strain. The tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed Spontaneous from thy bosom burst. Then come, O best of seers, relate The life of Ráma good and great, The tale that saintly Nárad told, In all its glorious length unfold. Of all the deeds his arm has done Upon this earth, omit not one, And thus the noble life record Of that wise, brave, and virtuous lord. His every act to day displayed, His secret life to none betrayed: How Lakshma G, how the giants fought; With high emprise and hidden thought: And all that Janak's child49 befell Where all could see, where none could tell. The whole of this shall truly be Made known, O best of saints, to thee. In all thy poem, through my grace, No word of falsehood shall have place.

The pupils of the holy man, Moved by their love of him, began To chant that verse, and ever more They marvelled as they sang it o'er: “Behold, the four-lined balanced rime, Repeated over many a time, In words that from the hermit broke In shock of grief, becomes a[loke.” This measure now Válmíki chose Wherein his story to compose. In hundreds of such verses, sweet With equal lines and even feet, The saintly poet, lofty-souled, The glorious deeds of Ráma told. 50 “I congratulate myself,” says Schlegel in the preface to his, alas, unfinished edition of the Rámáyan,“that, by the favour of the Supreme Deity, I have been allowed to begin so great a work; I glory and make my boast that I too after so many ages have helped to confirm that ancient oracle declared to Válmíki by the Father of Gods and men: Dum stabunt montes, campis dum flumina current, Usque tuum toto carmen celebrabitur orbe.”

Thus good Válmíki, sage divine, Rehearsed the tale of Raghu's line, As Nárad, heavenly saint, before Had traced the story's outline o'er. He sang of Ráma's princely birth, His kindness and heroic worth; His love for all, his patient youth, His gentleness and constant truth, And many a tale and legend old By holy Vi[vámitra told. How Janak's child he wooed and won, And broke the bow that bent to none. How he with every virtue fraught His namesake Ráma54 met and fought. The choice of Ráma for the throne; The malice by Kaikeyí shown, Whose evil counsel marred the plan And drove him forth a banisht man. How the king grieved and groaned, and cried, And swooned away and pining died. The subjects' woe when thus bereft; And how the following crowds he left: With Guha talked, and firmly stern Ordered his driver to return. How Gangá's farther shore he gained; By Bharadvája entertained, 54 Para[uráma or Ráma with the Axe. See Canto LXXIV.
