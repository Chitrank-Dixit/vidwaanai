## Verses to Analyze

### Verse 1 (Ramayana 0.1886)
- **Original**: 1868 The Ramayana relative to the Uttara Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really existing country of that name in the far north, yet that the descriptions there given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise, and not as founded on any recollections of the northern origin of the Kurus. It is probable, he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed, and still survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in latter times.” M UIR 'S Sanskrit Texts, Vol. II. pp. 336, 337. . Trust to these mighty Vánars. The corresponding passage in the Bengal recension has“these silvans in the forms of monkeys, vánaráh kapirupinah.” “Here it manifestly appears,” says Gorresio,“that these hosts of com- batants whom Ráma led to the conquest of Lanká (Ceylon) the kingdom and seat of the Hamitic race, and whom the poem calls monkeys, were in fact as I have elsewhere observed, inhabitants of the mountainous and southern regions of India, who were wild-looking and not altogether unlike monkeys. They were perhaps the remote ancestors of the Malay races.” [552] . "Art thou not he who slew of old The Serpent-Gods, and stormed their hold."

### Verse 2 (Ramayana 0.1887)
- **Original**: . 1869 All these exploits of RávaG are detailed in theUttarakáG a, and epitomized in the Appendix. . Within the consecrated hall. The Bráhman householder ought to maintain three sacred fires, theGárhapatya, theAhavaniyaand theDakshiGa. These three fires were made use of in many Brahmanical solemnities, for example in funeral rites when the three fires were arranged in prescribed order. . Fair Punjikasthalá I met. “I have not noticed in the Úttara KáGda any story about the daughter of VaruGa, but the commentator on the text (VI 60, 11) explains the allusion to her thus: “The daughter of VaruGa was Punjikasthalí. On her account, a curse of Brahmá, involving the penalty of death, [was pro- nounced] on the rape of women.” M UIR ,Sanskrit Texts, Part IV. Appendix. . “Shall no funereal honours grace The parted lord of Raghu's race?”

### Verse 3 (Ramayana 0.1888)
- **Original**: 1870 The Ramayana “Here are indicated those admirable rites and those funeral prayers which Professor Müller has described in his excellent work, Die Todtenbestattung bei den Brahmanen, Sítá laments that the body of Ráma will not be honoured with those rites and prayers, nor will the Bráhman priest while laying the ashes from the pile in the bosom of the earth, pronounce over them those solemn and magnificent words:‘Go unto the earth, thy mother, the ample, wide, and blessed earth.… And do thou, O Earth, open and receive him as a friend with sweet greeting: enfold him in thy bosom as a mother wraps her child in her robes.’ ” G ORRESIO . . Each glorious sign That stamps the future queen is mine. We read in Josephus that Caesar was so well versed in chiro- mancy that when one day asoi-disantson of Herod had audience of him, he at once detected the impostor because his hand was destitute of all marks of royalty. . In battle's wild Gandharva dance.

### Verse 4 (Ramayana 0.1889)
- **Original**: . 1871 “Here the commentator explains:‘the battle resembled the dance of the Gandharvas,’ in accordance with the notion of the Gand- harvas entertained in his day. They were regarded as celestial musicians enlivening with their melodies Indra's heaven and[553] the banquets of the Gods. But the Gandharvas before becoming celestial musicians in popular tradition, were in the primitive and true signification of the name heroes, spirited and ardent warriors, followers of Indra, and combined the heroical character with their atmospherical deity. Under this aspect the dance of the Gandharvas may be a very different thing from what the commentator means, and may signify the horrid dance of war.” G ORRESIO . The Homeric expression is similar,“to dance a war-dance before Ares.” . By AnaraGya's lips of old. “The story of AnaraGya is told in the Uttara KaG a of the Rámáya Ga.… AnaraGya a descendant of Ixváku and King of Ay- odhyá, when called upon to fight with RávaGa or acknowledge himself conquered, prefers the former alternative; but his army is overcome, and he himself is thrown from his chariot. When Ráva Ga triumphs over his prostrate foe, the latter says that he has been vanquished not by him but by fate, and that RávaGa is only the instrument of his overthrow; and he predicts that RávaGa shall one day be slain by his descendant Ráma.” Sanskrit Texts, IV., Appendix.

### Verse 5 (Ramayana 0.1890)
- **Original**: 1872 The Ramayana . “With regard to the magic image of Sítá made by Indrajit, we may observe that this thoroughly oriental idea is also found in Greece in Homer's Iliad, where Apollo forms an image of Æneas to save that hero beloved by the Gods: it occurs too in the Æneid of Virgil where Juno forms a fictitious Æneas to save Turnus: Tum dea nube cava tenuem sine viribus umbram In faciem Æneæ (visu mirabile monstrum) Dardaniis ornat telis; clipeumque jubasque Divini assimulat capitis; dat inania verba; Dat sine mente sonum, gressusque effingit euntis. (Æneidos, lib. X.)” G ORRESIO . . "To Raghu's son my chariot lend." “Analogous to this passage of the Rámáyana, where Indra sends to Ráma his own chariot, his own charioteer, and his own arms, is the passage in the Æneid where Venus descending from heaven brings celestial arms to her son Æneas when he is about to enter the battle: At Venus æthereos inter dea candida nimbos Dona fereus aderat;… … Arma sub adversa posuit radiantia quercum. Ille, deæ donis et tanto lætus honore, Expleri nequit, atque oculus per singula volvit, Miraturque, interque manus et brachia versat Terribilem cristis galeam flammasque vomentem, Fatiferumque ensem, loricam ex ære rigentem.

### Verse 6 (Ramayana 0.1891)
- **Original**: . 1873 (Æneidos, lib. VIII)” G ORRESIO . [554] . Agastya came and gently spake. “The Muni or saint Agastya, author of several Vedic hymns, was celebrated in Indo-Sanskrit tradition for having directed the first brahmanical settlements in the southern regions of India; and the Mahábhárata gives him the credit of having subjected those countries, expelled the Rákshases. and given security to the solitary ascetics, who were settled there. Hence Agastya was regarded in ancient legend as the conqueror and ruler of the southern country. This tradition refers to the earliest migrations made by the Sanskrit Indians towards the south of India. To Agastya are attributed many marvellous mythic deeds which adumbrate and veil ancient events; some of which are alluded to here and there in the Rámáyana.” G ORRESIO . The following is the literal translation of the Canto, text and commentary, from the Calcutta edition: Having found Ráma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought, and RávaG standing before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya, who had come to see the battle, approached Ráma and spoke to him thus:“O mighty Ráma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy foes in the battle. Having daily repeated the Ádityahridaya (the delighter of the mind of the Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who repeats it) gives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life, and which is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun who is respected by both

### Verse 13 (Ramayana 0.1898)
- **Original**: 1880 The Ramayana “In the funeral ceremonies of India the fire was placed on three sides of the pyre; theDakshiGa on the south, theGárhapatyaon the west, and theÁhavaníyaon the east. The funeral rites are not described in detail here, and it is therefore difficult to elucidate and explain them. The poem assigns the funeral ceremonies of Aryan Brahmans to the Rákshases, a race different from them in origin and religion, in the same way as Homer sometimes introduces into Troy the rites of the Grecian cult.” G ORRESIO . Mr. Muir translates the description of the funeral from the Calcutta edition, as follows:“They formed, with Vedic rites, a funeral pile of faggots of sandal-wood, withpadmaka wood, u[i- ragrass, and sandal, and covered with a quilt of deer's hair. They then performed an unrivalled obsequial ceremony for the Ráxasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground to the S.E. and the fire in the proper situation. They cast the ladle filled with curds and ghee on the shoulder1157 of the deceased; he (?) placed the car on the feet, and the mortar between the thighs. Having deposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and lower fire-wood, and the other pestle, in their proper places, they departed. The Ráxasas having then slain a victim to their prince in the manner prescribed in theZástras, and enjoined by great rishis, cast [into the fire] the coverlet of the king saturated with ghee. They then, VibhíshaGa included, with afflicted hearts, adorned RávaGa with perfumes and garlands, and with various vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain. VibhíshaGa having bathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper formtilaseeds mixed with darbha grass, and moistened with water, applied the fire [to the pile].” 1157 According to Ápastamba (says the commentator)“it should have been placed on the nose: this must therefore have been done in conformity with some other Sútras.”

### Verse 14 (Ramayana 0.1899)
- **Original**: . 1881 . The following is a literal translation of Brahmá's address to Ráma according to the Calcutta edition, text and commentary: “O Ráma, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all those who have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as thou art, suffer Sítá to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself as the best of the gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus,1158 and also their lord and creator. Thou art thyself the lord and first creator of the three worlds. Thou art the eighth (that is Mahádeva) of the Rudras,1159 and also the fifth1160 of the Sádhyas.1161 (The poet describes Ráma as made of the following gods) The A[vinikumáras (the twin divine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun and the moon are thy eyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the end of creation. How dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka} like a man whose actions are directed by the dictates of nature?” Thus addressed by Indra, Brahmá and the other[559] gods, Ráma the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world and the best of the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods.“As I take myself to be a man of the name of Ráma and son of Da[aratha, therefore, sir, please tell me who I am and whence have I come.” “O thou whose might is never failing,” said Brahmá to Kákutstha the foremost of those who thoroughly know Brahmá,“Thou art NáráyaGa,1162 almighty, possessed of fortune, and armed with the discus. Thou art the boar1163 with one tusk; the conqueror of thy past and future foes. Thou art Brahmá true and eternal or undecaying. Thou art Vi[vaksena,1164 having four arms; Thou art 1158 A class of eight gods. 1159 A class of eleven gods called Rudras. 1160 Named Víryaván. 1161 A class of divine devotees named Sádhyas. 1162 One who resides in the water. 1163 The third incarnation of VishGu, that bore the earth on his tusk. 1164 One whose armies are everywhere.

The horns are here the Sákhás of the Sáma-veda. 1171 One who has a hundred heads. The heads are here meant to devote a hundred commandments of the Vedas. 1172 Siddhas are those who have already gained the summit of their desires. 1173 Sádhyas are those that are still trying to gain the summit. 1174 A mystic syllable uttered in Mantras. 1175 A mystic syllable made of the letters which respectively denote Brahmá, VishGu, andZiva.

The Vedas are thy Sanskáras.1177 Nothing can exist without thee. The whole world is thy body; the surface of the earth is thy stability.” [560] O ZrívatsalakshaGa, fire is thy anger, and the moon is thy favour. In the time of thy incarnation named Vámana, thou didst pervade the three worlds with thy three steps; and Mahendra was made the king of paradise by thee having confined the fearful Bali.1178 Sítá (thy wife) is Lakshmí; and thou art the God VishGu,1179 KrishGa,1180 and Prajápati. To kill RávaG thou hast assumed the form of a man; therefore, O best of the virtuous, thou hast completed this task imposed by us (gods). O Ráma, RávaGa has been killed by thee: now being joyful (i.e. having for some time reigned in the kingdom of Ayodhyá,) go to paradise. O glorious Ráma, thy power and thy valour are never failing. The visit to thee and the prayers made to thee are never fruitless. Thy devotees will never be unsuccessful. Thy devotees who obtain thee (thy favour) who art first and best of mankind, shall obtain their desires in this world as well as in the next. They who recite this prayer, founded on the Vedas (or first uttered by the sages), and the old and divine account of (Ráma) shall never suffer defeat.” .

### Verse 17 (Ramayana 0.1902)
- **Original**: 1884 The Ramayana The Bharat-Milápor meeting with Bharat, is the closing scene of the dramatic representation of Ráma's great victory and tri- umphant return which takes place annually in October in many of the cities of Northern India. The Rám-Lalá or Play of Ráma, as the great drama is called, is performed in the open air and lasts with one day's break through fifteen successive days. At Benares there are three nearly simultaneous performances, one provided by H. H. the Maharajah of Benares near his palace at Ramnaggur, one by H. H. the Maharajah of Vizianagram near the Missionary settlement at Sigra and at other places in the city, and one by the leading gentry of the city at Chowká Ghát near the College. The scene especially on the great day when the brothers meet is most interesting: the procession of elephants with their gorgeous howdahs of silver and gold and their magnificently dressed riders with priceless jewels sparkling in their turbans, the enthusiasm of the thousands of spectators who fill the streets and squares, the balconies and the housetops, the flowers that are rained down upon the advancing car, the wild music, the shouting and the joy, make an impression that is not easily forgotten. Still on his head, well trained in lore Of duty, Ráma's shoes he bore. Ráma's shoes are here regarded as the emblems of royalty or possession. We may compare the Hebrew“Over Edom will I cast forth my shoe.” A curiously similar passage occurs in LYSCHANDER 'S Chronicon Greenlandiæ Rhythmicon: “Han sendte til Irland sin skiden skoe, Og böd den Konge. Som der monne boe, Han skulde dem hæderlig bære Pan Juuledag i sin kongelig Pragt, Og kjende han havde sit Rige og Magt Af Norges og Quernes Herre.”

I end these notes with an extract which I translate from Signor Gorresio's Preface to the tenth volume of his Rámáyan, and I take this opportunity of again thankfully acknowledging my great obligations to this eminentZanskritist from whom I have so frequently borrowed. As Mr. Muir has observed, the Ben- gal recension which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited is throughout an admirable commentary on the genuine Rámáyan of northern India, and I have made constant reference to the faithful and elegant translation which accompanies the text for assistance and confirmation in difficulties: “Towards the southern extremity and in the island of Lanká (Ceylon) there existed undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and hostile to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the islands of the Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this day. The Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred which occurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested beings, called it the Rákshas race: it is against these Rákshases that the expedition of Ráma which the Rámáyan celebrates is directed. The Sanskrit-Indians certainly

### Verse 19 (Ramayana 0.1904)
- **Original**: 1886 The Ramayana altered in their traditions the real character of this race: they attributed to it physical and moral qualities not found in human nature; they transformed it into a race of giants; they represent- ed it as monstrous, hideous, truculent, changing forms at will, blood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the Semites represented the races that opposed them as impious, horrible and of monstrous size. But notwithstanding these mythical exaggerations, which are partly due to the genius of the Aryans so prone to magnify everything without measure, the Rámáyan in the course of its epic narration has still preserved and noted here and there some traits and peculiarities of the race which reveal its true character. It represents the Rákshases as black of hue, and compares them with black clouds and masses of black collyrium; it attributes to them curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts them as loaded with chains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments which their race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the Soudan still delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force. They are hostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they disturb and ruin … Such is the Rákshas race as represented in the Rámáyan; and the war of the Aryan Ráma forms the subject of the epic, a subject certainly real and historical as far as regards its substance, but greatly exaggerated by the ancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found traces of another struggle of the Aryans with the Rákshas races, which preceded the war of Ráma. According to some pauranic legends, Kárttavírya, a descendant of the royal tribe of the Yádavas, contemporary with Parasurama and a little anterior to Ráma, attacked Lanká and took RávaG prisoner. This well shows how ancient and how deeply rooted in the Aryan race is the thought of this war which the Rámáyan celebrates.[562] “But,” says an eminent Indianist1181 whose learning I highly appreciate,“the Rámáyan is an allegorical epic, and no precise 1181 A.

### Verse 20 (Ramayana 0.1905)
- **Original**: Final Notes. 1887 and historical value can be assigned to it. Sítá signifies the furrow made by the plough, and under this symbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in the hymns of the Rig-veda; Ráma is the bearer of the plough (this assertion is entirely gratuitous); these two allegorical personages represented agriculture introduced to the southern regions of India by the race of the Kosalas from whom Ráma was descended; the Rák- shases on whom he makes war are races of demons and giants who have little or nothing human about them; allegory therefore predominates in the poem, and the exact reality of an historical event must not be looked for in it.” Such is Professor Weber's opinion. If he means to say that mythical fictions are mingled with real events, Forsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote, as Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth with the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the primitive epopeia. If Sítá is born, as the Rámáyan feigns, from the furrow which King Janak opened when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real is the origin of Helen and Æneas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if the characters in the Rámáyan exceed human nature, and in a greater degree perhaps than is the case in analogous epics, this springs in part from the nature of the subject and still more from the symbol-loving genius of the orient. Still the characters of the Rámáyan, although they exceed more or less the limits of human nature, act notwithstanding in the course of the poem, speak, feel, rejoice and grieve according to the natural impulse of human pas- sions. But if by saying that the Rámáyan is an allegorical epic, it is meant that its fundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the war of the Aryan Ráma against the Rákshas race is an allegory, that the conquest of the southern region and of the island of Lanká is an allegory, I do not hesitate to answer that such a presumption cannot be admitted and that the thing is in
