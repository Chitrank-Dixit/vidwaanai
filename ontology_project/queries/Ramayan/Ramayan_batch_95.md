In the Digvijaya of Nakula he subdues the Matsyas further to the west, or Gujerat.” W ILSON 'S{FNS VishGu PuráGa, Vol. II. 158. Dr. Hall observes:“In theMahábhárata Sabhá-parwan, 1105 and 1108, notice is taken of the king of Matsya and of the Aparamatsyas; and, at 1082, the Matsyas figure as an eastern people. They are placed among the nations of the south in theRámáya Ga Kishkindhá-káGda, XLI., II, while the Bengal recension,Kishkindhá-káG a, XLIV., 12, locates them in the north.” 1058 The Kalingas were the people of the upper part of the Coromandel Coast, well known, in the traditions of the Eastern Archipelago, as Kling. Ptole- my has a city in that part, called Caliga; and Pliny Calingæ proximi mari. W ILSON 'S{FNS VishGu PuráGa, Vol. II. 156, Note. 1059 The Kau[ikas do not appear to be identifiable. 1060 The Andhras probably occupied the modern Telingana. 1061 The PuG ras have already been mentioned in Canto XL.

Those here named are some of the people of the deserts along the Indus; but Pulindas are met with in many other positions, especially in the mountains and forests across Central India, the haunts of the Bheels and Gonds. So Ptolemy places the Pulindas along the banks of the Narmadá, to the frontiers of Larice, the Látá or Lár of the Hindus,— Khandesh and part of Gujerat.” W ILSON 'S{FNS VishGu PuráGa, Vol. II. 159, Note. Dr. Hall observes that“in the Bengal recension of theRámáya Ga the Pulindas appear both in the south and in the north. The realRámáya Ga K.-k., XLIII., speaks of the northern Pulindas.” 1067 The Zúrasenas were the inhabitants of Mathurá, the Suraseni of Arrian. 1068 These the Mardi of the Greeks and the two preceding tribes appear to have dwelt in the north-west of Hindustan.

- **Original**: 1866 The Ramayana jas1069 and the Yavanas1070 and the towns of theZakas1071 and the Varadas.”1072 . Northern Kurus. Professor Lassen remarks in the Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, ii. 62:“At the furthest accessible extremity of the earth appears Harivarsha with the northern Kurus. The region of Hari or VishGu belongs to the system of mythical geography; but the case is different with the Uttara Kurus. Here there is a real basis of geographical fact; of which fable has only taken advantage, without creating it. The Uttara Kurus were formerly quite independent of the mythical system ofdvípas, though they were included in it at an early date.” Again the same writer says at p. 65:“That the conception of the Uttara Kurus is based upon an actual country and not on mere invention, is proved (1) by the way in which they are mentioned in the Vedas; (2) by the[551] existence of Uttara Kuru in historical times as a real country; and 1069 The Kámbojas are said to be the people of Arachosia. They are always mentioned with the north-western tribes. 1070 “The term Yavanas, although, in later times, applied to the Mohammedans, designated formerly the Greeks.… The Greeks were known throughout West- ern Asia by the term Yavan, or Ion. That the Macedonian or Bactrian Greeks were most usually intended is not only probable from their position and rela- tions with India, but from their being usually named in concurrence with the north-western tribes, Kámbojas, Daradas, Páradas, Báhlíkas,Zakas &c., in the Rámáya Ga. Mahábhárata, Puránas, Manu, and in various poems and plays.” W ILSON 'S{FNS VishGu PuráGa Vol. II. p. 181, Note. 1071 These people, the Sakai and Sacæ of classical writers, the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, extended, about the commencement of our era, along the west of India, from the Hindu Kosh to the mouths of the Indus. 1072 The corresponding passage in the Bengal recension has instead of Varadas Daradas the Dards or inhabitants of the modern Dardistan along the course of the Indus, above the Himálayas, just before it descends to India.

### Verse 5 (Ramayan 0.1885)
- **Original**: . Northern Kurus. 1867 (3) by the way in which the legend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive customs. To begin with the last point the Mahábhárata speaks as follows of the freer mode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:‘Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure, in- dependent. Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their husbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early times. This ancient custom is even now the law for creatures born as brutes, which are free from lust and anger. This custom is supported by authority and is observed by great rishis, and it isstill practiced among the northern Kurus.’ “The idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of the world of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age. To afford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is said in another place (M.-Bh, i. 4346.) ‘The southern Kurus vied in happiness with the northern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards.’ Professor Lassen goes on to say:‘Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted withUttara Kuru. He speaks of a mountain, a peo- ple, and a city calledOttorakorra. Most of the other ancient authors who elsewhere mention this name, have it from him. It is a part of the country which he calls Serica; according to him the city lies twelve degrees west from the metropolis of Sera, and the mountain extends from thence far to the eastward. As Ptolemy has misplaced the whole of eastern Asia beyond the Ganges, therelativeposition which he assigns will guide us better that the absolute one, which removesOttorakorraso far to the east that a correction is inevitable. According to my opinion theOttorakorraof Ptolemy must be sought for to the east of Kashgar.’ Lassen also thinks that Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus in view when he referred to the Hyperboreans who were fabled by Indian writers to live a thousand years. In his Indian antiquities, (Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511, 512. and note,) the same writer concludes that though the passages above cited

### Verse 6 (Ramayan 0.1886)
- **Original**: 1868 The Ramayana relative to the Uttara Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really existing country of that name in the far north, yet that the descriptions there given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise, and not as founded on any recollections of the northern origin of the Kurus. It is probable, he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed, and still survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in latter times.” M UIR 'S Sanskrit Texts, Vol. II. pp. 336, 337. . Trust to these mighty Vánars. The corresponding passage in the Bengal recension has“these silvans in the forms of monkeys, vánaráh kapirupinah.” “Here it manifestly appears,” says Gorresio,“that these hosts of com- batants whom Ráma led to the conquest of Lanká (Ceylon) the kingdom and seat of the Hamitic race, and whom the poem calls monkeys, were in fact as I have elsewhere observed, inhabitants of the mountainous and southern regions of India, who were wild-looking and not altogether unlike monkeys. They were perhaps the remote ancestors of the Malay races.” [552] . "Art thou not he who slew of old The Serpent-Gods, and stormed their hold."

The Bráhman householder ought to maintain three sacred fires, theGárhapatya, theAhavaniyaand theDakshiGa. These three fires were made use of in many Brahmanical solemnities, for example in funeral rites when the three fires were arranged in prescribed order. . Fair Punjikasthalá I met. “I have not noticed in the Úttara KáGda any story about the daughter of VaruGa, but the commentator on the text (VI 60, 11) explains the allusion to her thus: “The daughter of VaruGa was Punjikasthalí. On her account, a curse of Brahmá, involving the penalty of death, [was pro- nounced] on the rape of women.” M UIR ,Sanskrit Texts, Part IV. Appendix. . “Shall no funereal honours grace The parted lord of Raghu's race?”

### Verse 8 (Ramayan 0.1888)
- **Original**: 1870 The Ramayana “Here are indicated those admirable rites and those funeral prayers which Professor Müller has described in his excellent work, Die Todtenbestattung bei den Brahmanen, Sítá laments that the body of Ráma will not be honoured with those rites and prayers, nor will the Bráhman priest while laying the ashes from the pile in the bosom of the earth, pronounce over them those solemn and magnificent words:‘Go unto the earth, thy mother, the ample, wide, and blessed earth.… And do thou, O Earth, open and receive him as a friend with sweet greeting: enfold him in thy bosom as a mother wraps her child in her robes.’ ” G ORRESIO . . Each glorious sign That stamps the future queen is mine. We read in Josephus that Caesar was so well versed in chiro- mancy that when one day asoi-disantson of Herod had audience of him, he at once detected the impostor because his hand was destitute of all marks of royalty. . In battle's wild Gandharva dance.

### Verse 9 (Ramayan 0.1889)
- **Original**: . 1871 “Here the commentator explains:‘the battle resembled the dance of the Gandharvas,’ in accordance with the notion of the Gand- harvas entertained in his day. They were regarded as celestial musicians enlivening with their melodies Indra's heaven and[553] the banquets of the Gods. But the Gandharvas before becoming celestial musicians in popular tradition, were in the primitive and true signification of the name heroes, spirited and ardent warriors, followers of Indra, and combined the heroical character with their atmospherical deity. Under this aspect the dance of the Gandharvas may be a very different thing from what the commentator means, and may signify the horrid dance of war.” G ORRESIO . The Homeric expression is similar,“to dance a war-dance before Ares.” . By AnaraGya's lips of old. “The story of AnaraGya is told in the Uttara KaG a of the Rámáya Ga.… AnaraGya a descendant of Ixváku and King of Ay- odhyá, when called upon to fight with RávaGa or acknowledge himself conquered, prefers the former alternative; but his army is overcome, and he himself is thrown from his chariot. When Ráva Ga triumphs over his prostrate foe, the latter says that he has been vanquished not by him but by fate, and that RávaGa is only the instrument of his overthrow; and he predicts that RávaGa shall one day be slain by his descendant Ráma.” Sanskrit Texts, IV., Appendix.

### Verse 10 (Ramayan 0.1890)
- **Original**: 1872 The Ramayana . “With regard to the magic image of Sítá made by Indrajit, we may observe that this thoroughly oriental idea is also found in Greece in Homer's Iliad, where Apollo forms an image of Æneas to save that hero beloved by the Gods: it occurs too in the Æneid of Virgil where Juno forms a fictitious Æneas to save Turnus: Tum dea nube cava tenuem sine viribus umbram In faciem Æneæ (visu mirabile monstrum) Dardaniis ornat telis; clipeumque jubasque Divini assimulat capitis; dat inania verba; Dat sine mente sonum, gressusque effingit euntis. (Æneidos, lib. X.)” G ORRESIO . . "To Raghu's son my chariot lend." “Analogous to this passage of the Rámáyana, where Indra sends to Ráma his own chariot, his own charioteer, and his own arms, is the passage in the Æneid where Venus descending from heaven brings celestial arms to her son Æneas when he is about to enter the battle: At Venus æthereos inter dea candida nimbos Dona fereus aderat;… … Arma sub adversa posuit radiantia quercum. Ille, deæ donis et tanto lætus honore, Expleri nequit, atque oculus per singula volvit, Miraturque, interque manus et brachia versat Terribilem cristis galeam flammasque vomentem, Fatiferumque ensem, loricam ex ære rigentem.

### Verse 11 (Ramayan 0.1891)
- **Original**: . 1873 (Æneidos, lib. VIII)” G ORRESIO . [554] . Agastya came and gently spake. “The Muni or saint Agastya, author of several Vedic hymns, was celebrated in Indo-Sanskrit tradition for having directed the first brahmanical settlements in the southern regions of India; and the Mahábhárata gives him the credit of having subjected those countries, expelled the Rákshases. and given security to the solitary ascetics, who were settled there. Hence Agastya was regarded in ancient legend as the conqueror and ruler of the southern country. This tradition refers to the earliest migrations made by the Sanskrit Indians towards the south of India. To Agastya are attributed many marvellous mythic deeds which adumbrate and veil ancient events; some of which are alluded to here and there in the Rámáyana.” G ORRESIO . The following is the literal translation of the Canto, text and commentary, from the Calcutta edition: Having found Ráma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought, and RávaG standing before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya, who had come to see the battle, approached Ráma and spoke to him thus:“O mighty Ráma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy foes in the battle. Having daily repeated the Ádityahridaya (the delighter of the mind of the Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who repeats it) gives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life, and which is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun who is respected by both

### Verse 18 (Ramayan 0.1898)
- **Original**: 1880 The Ramayana “In the funeral ceremonies of India the fire was placed on three sides of the pyre; theDakshiGa on the south, theGárhapatyaon the west, and theÁhavaníyaon the east. The funeral rites are not described in detail here, and it is therefore difficult to elucidate and explain them. The poem assigns the funeral ceremonies of Aryan Brahmans to the Rákshases, a race different from them in origin and religion, in the same way as Homer sometimes introduces into Troy the rites of the Grecian cult.” G ORRESIO . Mr. Muir translates the description of the funeral from the Calcutta edition, as follows:“They formed, with Vedic rites, a funeral pile of faggots of sandal-wood, withpadmaka wood, u[i- ragrass, and sandal, and covered with a quilt of deer's hair. They then performed an unrivalled obsequial ceremony for the Ráxasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground to the S.E. and the fire in the proper situation. They cast the ladle filled with curds and ghee on the shoulder1157 of the deceased; he (?) placed the car on the feet, and the mortar between the thighs. Having deposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and lower fire-wood, and the other pestle, in their proper places, they departed. The Ráxasas having then slain a victim to their prince in the manner prescribed in theZástras, and enjoined by great rishis, cast [into the fire] the coverlet of the king saturated with ghee. They then, VibhíshaGa included, with afflicted hearts, adorned RávaGa with perfumes and garlands, and with various vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain. VibhíshaGa having bathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper formtilaseeds mixed with darbha grass, and moistened with water, applied the fire [to the pile].” 1157 According to Ápastamba (says the commentator)“it should have been placed on the nose: this must therefore have been done in conformity with some other Sútras.”

### Verse 19 (Ramayan 0.1899)
- **Original**: . 1881 . The following is a literal translation of Brahmá's address to Ráma according to the Calcutta edition, text and commentary: “O Ráma, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all those who have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as thou art, suffer Sítá to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself as the best of the gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus,1158 and also their lord and creator. Thou art thyself the lord and first creator of the three worlds. Thou art the eighth (that is Mahádeva) of the Rudras,1159 and also the fifth1160 of the Sádhyas.1161 (The poet describes Ráma as made of the following gods) The A[vinikumáras (the twin divine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun and the moon are thy eyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the end of creation. How dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka} like a man whose actions are directed by the dictates of nature?” Thus addressed by Indra, Brahmá and the other[559] gods, Ráma the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world and the best of the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods.“As I take myself to be a man of the name of Ráma and son of Da[aratha, therefore, sir, please tell me who I am and whence have I come.” “O thou whose might is never failing,” said Brahmá to Kákutstha the foremost of those who thoroughly know Brahmá,“Thou art NáráyaGa,1162 almighty, possessed of fortune, and armed with the discus. Thou art the boar1163 with one tusk; the conqueror of thy past and future foes. Thou art Brahmá true and eternal or undecaying. Thou art Vi[vaksena,1164 having four arms; Thou art 1158 A class of eight gods. 1159 A class of eleven gods called Rudras. 1160 Named Víryaván. 1161 A class of divine devotees named Sádhyas. 1162 One who resides in the water. 1163 The third incarnation of VishGu, that bore the earth on his tusk. 1164 One whose armies are everywhere.
