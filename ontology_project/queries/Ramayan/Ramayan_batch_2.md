### Verse 1 (Ramayan 0.21)
- **Original**: Invocation. 3 The stream Rámáyan leaves its sacred fount The whole wide world from sin and stain to free.4 The Prince of Hermits is the parent mount, The lordly Ráma is the darling sea. Glory to him whose fame is ever bright! Glory to him, Prachetas'5holy son! Whose pure lips quaff with ever new delight The nectar-sea of deeds by Ráma done. Hail, arch-ascetic, pious, good, and kind! Hail, Saint Válmíki, lord of every lore! Hail, holy Hermit, calm and pure of mind! Hail, First of Bards, Válmíki, hail once more! um.” 4 Comparison with the Ganges is implied, that river being called the purifier of the world. 5 “This name may have been given to the father of Válmíki allegorically. If we look at the derivation of the word (pra, before, andchetas, mind) it is as if the poet were called the son of Prometheus, the Forethinker.” SCHLEGEL {FNS .

- **Original**: Book I.6 Canto I. Nárad.7 OM. 8 To sainted Nárad, prince of those Whose lore in words of wisdom flows. Whose constant care and chief delight Were Scripture and ascetic rite, The good Válmíki, first and best[002] Of hermit saints, these words addressed:9 “In all this world, I pray thee, who Is virtuous, heroic, true? Firm in his vows, of grateful mind, To every creature good and kind? Bounteous, and holy, just, and wise, Alone most fair to all men's eyes? Devoid of envy, firm, and sage, 6 Called in Sanskrit alsoBála-KáG a, and in HindíBál-KáG ,i.e.the Book describing Ráma's childhood,bálameaning a boy up to his sixteenth year. 7 A divine saint, son of Brahmá. He is the eloquent messenger of the Gods, a musician of exquisite skill, and the inventor of thevíGá or Indian lute. He bears a strong resemblance to Hermes or Mercury. 8 This mystic syllable, said to typify the supreme Deity, the Gods collectively, the Vedas, the three spheres of the world, the three holy fires, the three steps of VishGu etc., prefaces the prayers and most venerated writings of the Hindus. 9 This colloquy is supposed to have taken place about sixteen years after Ráma's return from his wanderings and occupation of his ancestral throne.

### Verse 3 (Ramayan 0.23)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 5 Whose tranquil soul ne'er yields to rage? Whom, when his warrior wrath is high, Do Gods embattled fear and fly? Whose noble might and gentle skill The triple world can guard from ill? Who is the best of princes, he Who loves his people's good to see? The store of bliss, the living mine Where brightest joys and virtues shine? Queen Fortune's10 best and dearest friend, Whose steps her choicest gifts attend? Who may with Sun and Moon compare, With Indra,11 VishGu,12 Fire, and Air?

- **Original**: 6 The Ramayana Made ready answer:“Hermit, where Are graces found so high and rare? Yet listen, and my tongue shall tell In whom alone these virtues dwell. From old Ikshváku's15 line he came, Known to the world by Ráma's name: With soul subdued, a chief of might, In Scripture versed, in glory bright, His steps in virtue's paths are bent, Obedient, pure, and eloquent. In each emprise he wins success, And dying foes his power confess. Tall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb, Fortune has set her mark on him. Graced with a conch-shell's triple line, His throat displays the auspicious sign.16[003] futurorum eventuum in unguibus atque etiam in dentibus.” Though the palmy days of Indian chiromancy have passed away, the art is still to some extent studied and believed in. quote Homer's.

### Verse 5 (Ramayan 0.25)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 7 High destiny is clear impressed On massive jaw and ample chest, His mighty shafts he truly aims, And foemen in the battle tames. Deep in the muscle, scarcely shown, Embedded lies his collar-bone. His lordly steps are firm and free, His strong arms reach below his knee;17 All fairest graces join to deck His head, his brow, his stately neck, And limbs in fair proportion set: The manliest form e'er fashioned yet. Graced with each high imperial mark, His skin is soft and lustrous dark. Large are his eyes that sweetly shine With majesty almost divine. His plighted word he ne'er forgets; On erring sense a watch he sets. By nature wise, his teacher's skill Has trained him to subdue his will. Good, resolute and pure, and strong, He guards mankind from scathe and wrong, And lends his aid, and ne'er in vain, The cause of justice to maintain. Well has he studied o'er and o'er or universal emperor. In the palmistry of Europe the line of fortune, as well as the line of life, is in the hand.

Well skilled is he the bow to draw,19 Well trained in arts and versed in law; High-souled and meet for happy fate, Most tender and compassionate; The noblest of all lordly givers, Whom good men follow, as the rivers Follow the King of Floods, the sea: So liberal, so just is he. 18 “Veda means originally knowing or knowledge, and this name is given by the Bráhmans not to one work, but to the whole body of their most ancient sacred literature. Veda is the same word which appears in the Greek¿w´±, I know, and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The name of Veda is commonly given to four collections of hymns, which are respectively known by the names of Rig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sáma-veda, and Atharva-veda.” “As the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit, is the most ancient type of the English of the present day, (Sanskrit and English are but varieties of one and the same language,) so its thoughts and feelings contain in reality the first roots and germs of that intellectual growth which by an unbroken chain connects our own generation with the ancestors of the Aryan race,— with those very people who at the rising and setting of the sun listened with trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda, that told them of bright powers above, and of a life to come after the sun of their own lives had set in the clouds of the evening. These men were the true ancestors of our race, and the Veda is the oldest book we have in which to study the first beginnings of our language, and of all that is embodied in language. We are by nature Aryan, Indo-European, not Semitic: our spiritual kith and kin are to be found in India, Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Palestine.” Chips from a German Workshop, Vol. I. pp. 8. 4. 19 As with the ancient Persians and Scythians, Indian princes were carefully

With him, his best and eldest son, By all his princely virtues won King Da[aratha24 willed to share His kingdom as the Regent Heir. But when Kaikeyí, youngest queen, With eyes of envious hate had seen The solemn pomp and regal state Prepared the prince to consecrate, She bade the hapless king bestow Two gifts he promised long ago, That Ráma to the woods should flee, And that her child the heir should be. By chains of duty firmly tied, The wretched king perforce complied.

Then LakshmaG's truth was nobly shown, Then were his love and courage known, When for his brother's sake he dared All perils, and his exile shared. And Sítá, Ráma's darling wife, Loved even as he loved his life, Whom happy marks combined to bless, A miracle of loveliness, Of Janak's royal lineage sprung, Most excellent of women, clung To her dear lord, like RohiGí Rejoicing with the Moon to be.25 The King and people, sad of mood, The hero's car awhile pursued. But when Prince Ráma lighted down At Zringavera's pleasant town, Where Gangá's holy waters flow, 25 “Chandra, or the Moon, is fabled to have been married to the twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch Daksha, or A[viní and the rest, who are in fact personifications of the Lunar Asterisms. His favourite amongst them was RohiGí to whom he so wholly devoted himself as to neglect the rest. They complained to their father, and Daksha repeatedly interposed, till, finding his remonstrances vain, he denounced a curse upon his son-in-law, in consequence of which he remained childless and became affected by consumption. The wives of Chandra having interceded in his behalf with their father, Daksha modified an imprecation which he could not recall, and pronounced that the decay should be periodical only, not permanent, and that it should alternate with periods of recovery.

Then on from wood to wood they strayed, O'er many a stream, through constant shade, As Bharadvája bade them, till They came to Chitrakúma's hill. And Ráma there, with LakshmaG's aid, A pleasant little cottage made, And spent his days with Sítá, dressed In coat of bark and deerskin vest.26 And Chitrakúma grew to be As bright with those illustrious three As Meru's27 sacred peaks that shine With glory, when the Gods recline Beneath them:Ziva's28 self between The Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen. 26 The garb prescribed for ascetics by Manu. 27 “Mount Meru, situated like Kailása in the lofty regions to the north of the Himálayas, is celebrated in the traditions and myths of India. Meru and Kailása are the two Indian Olympi. Perhaps they were held in such veneration be- cause the Sanskrit-speaking Indians remembered the ancient home where they dwelt with the other primitive peoples of their family before they descended to occupy the vast plains which extend between the Indus and the Ganges.” G ORRESIO {FNS . 28 The third God of the Indian Triad, the God of destruction and reproduction.

### Verse 10 (Ramayan 0.30)
- **Original**: 12 The Ramayana The aged king for Ráma pined, And for the skies the earth resigned. Bharat, his son, refused to reign, Though urged by all the twice-born29 train. Forth to the woods he fared to meet His brother, fell before his feet, And cried,“Thy claim all men allow: O come, our lord and king be thou.” But Ráma nobly chose to be Observant of his sire's decree. He placed his sandals30 in his hand A pledge that he would rule the land: And bade his brother turn again. Then Bharat, finding prayer was vain, The sandals took and went away; Nor in Ayodhyá would he stay. But turned to Nandigráma, where He ruled the realm with watchful care, Still longing eagerly to learn Tidings of Ráma's safe return. Then lest the people should repeat Their visit to his calm retreat, Away from Chitrakúma's hill Fared Ráma ever onward till[005] 29 The epithetdwija, ortwice-born, is usually appropriate to Bráhmans, but is applicable to the three higher castes.

### Verse 11 (Ramayan 0.31)
- **Original**: Canto I. Nárad. 13 Beneath the shady trees he stood Of DaG aká's primeval wood, Virádha, giant fiend, he slew, And then Agastya's friendship knew. Counselled by him he gained the sword And bow of Indra, heavenly lord: A pair of quivers too, that bore Of arrows an exhaustless store. While there he dwelt in greenwood shade The trembling hermits sought his aid, And bade him with his sword and bow Destroy the fiends who worked them woe: To come like Indra strong and brave, A guardian God to help and save. And Ráma's falchion left its trace Deep cut onZúrpaGakhá's face: A hideous giantess who came Burning for him with lawless flame. Their sister's cries the giants heard. And vengeance in each bosom stirred: The monster of the triple head. And DúshaG to the contest sped. But they and myriad fiends beside Beneath the might of Ráma died. When Ráva G, dreaded warrior, knew The slaughter of his giant crew: RávaG, the king, whose name of fear Earth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear: He bade the fiend Márícha aid The vengeful plot his fury laid. In vain the wise Márícha tried To turn him from his course aside: Not RávaG's self, he said, might hope

### Verse 12 (Ramayan 0.32)
- **Original**: 14 The Ramayana With Ráma and his strength to cope. Impelled by fate and blind with rage He came to Ráma's hermitage. There, by Márícha's magic art, He wiled the princely youths apart, The vulture31 slew, and bore away The wife of Ráma as his prey. The son of Raghu32 came and found Jamáyu slain upon the ground. He rushed within his leafy cot; He sought his wife, but found her not. Then, then the hero's senses failed; In mad despair he wept and wailed. Upon the pile that bird he laid, And still in quest of Sítá strayed. A hideous giant then he saw, Kabandha named, a shape of awe. The monstrous fiend he smote and slew, And in the flame the body threw; When straight from out the funeral flame In lovely form Kabandha came, And bade him seek in his distress A wise and holy hermitess. By counsel of this saintly dame To Pampá's pleasant flood he came, And there the steadfast friendship won Of Hanumán the Wind-God's son. Counselled by him he told his grief 31 Jamáyu, a semi-divine bird, the friend of Ráma, who fought in defence of Sítá. 32 Raghu was one of the most celebrated ancestors of Ráma whose commonest appellation is, therefore, Rághava or descendant of Raghu. Kálidása in the RaghuraG[a makes him the son of Dilípa and great-grandfather of Ráma. See Idylls from the Sanskrit,“Aja” and “Dilípa.”

Sugríva to his new-found friend Told his own story to the end: His hate of Báli for the wrong And insult he had borne so long. And Ráma lent a willing ear And promised to allay his fear. Sugríva warned him of the might Of Báli, matchless in the fight, And, credence for his tale to gain, Showed the huge fiend33 by Báli slain. The prostrate corse of mountain size Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes; He lightly kicked it, as it lay, And cast it twenty leagues34 away. To prove his might his arrows through Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew. He cleft a mighty hill apart, And down to hell he hurled his dart. Then high Sugríva's spirit rose, Assured of conquest o'er his foes. With his new champion by his side To vast Kishkindhá's cave he hied. Then, summoned by his awful shout, King Báli came in fury out, First comforted his trembling wife, Then sought Sugríva in the strife. One shaft from Ráma's deadly bow The monarch in the dust laid low. 33 Dundhubi. 34 Literallyten yojanas.

### Verse 14 (Ramayan 0.34)
- **Original**: 16 The Ramayana Then Ráma bade Sugríva reign In place of royal Báli slain. Then speedy envoys hurried forth Eastward and westward, south and north, Commanded by the grateful king Tidings of Ráma's spouse to bring. Then by Sampáti's counsel led, Brave Hanumán, who mocked at dread, Sprang at one wild tremendous leap Two hundred leagues across the deep. To Lanká's35 town he urged his way, Where RávaG held his royal sway.[006] There pensive 'neath A[oka36 boughs He found poor Sítá, Ráma's spouse. He gave the hapless girl a ring, A token from her lord and king. A pledge from her fair hand he bore; Then battered down the garden door. Five captains of the host he slew, Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew; Crushed youthful Aksha on the field, Then to his captors chose to yield. Soon from their bonds his limbs were free, But honouring the high decree Which Brahmá37 had pronounced of yore, 35 Ceylon. 36 The Jonesia A[oka is a most beautiful tree bearing a profusion of red blossoms. 37 Brahmá , the Creator, is usually regarded as the first God of the Indian Trinity, although, as Kálidása says: “Of Brahmá, VishGu,Ziva, each may be First, second, third, amid the blessed Three.” Brahmá had guaranteed RávaG's life against all enemies except man.

The town he burnt with hostile flame, And spoke again with Ráma's dame, Then swiftly back to Ráma flew With tidings of the interview. Then with Sugríva for his guide, Came Ráma to the ocean side. He smote the sea with shafts as bright As sunbeams in their summer height, And quick appeared the Rivers' King38 Obedient to the summoning. A bridge was thrown by Nala o'er The narrow sea from shore to shore.39 They crossed to Lanká's golden town, Where Ráma's hand smote RávaG down. VibhishaG there was left to reign Over his brother's wide domain. To meet her husband Sítá came; But Ráma, stung with ire and shame, With bitter words his wife addressed Before the crowd that round her pressed. But Sítá, touched with noble ire, Gave her fair body to the fire. Then straight the God of Wind appeared, And words from heaven her honour cleared. And Ráma clasped his wife again, Uninjured, pure from spot and stain, Obedient to the Lord of Fire And the high mandate of his sire. Led by the Lord who rules the sky, 38 Ocean personified. 39 The rocks lying between Ceylon and the mainland are still called Ráma's Bridge by the Hindus.

His task achieved, his foe removed, He triumphed, by the Gods approved. By grace of Heaven he raised to life The chieftains slain in mortal strife; Then in the magic chariot through The clouds to Nandigráma flew. Met by his faithful brothers there, He loosed his votive coil of hair: Thence fair Ayodhyá's town he gained, And o'er his father's kingdom reigned. Disease or famine ne'er oppressed His happy people, richly blest With all the joys of ample wealth, Of sweet content and perfect health. No widow mourned her well-loved mate, No sire his son's untimely fate. They feared not storm or robber's hand; No fire or flood laid waste the land: The Golden Age40 had come again To bless the days of Ráma's reign. From him, the great and glorious king, Shall many a princely scion spring. And he shall rule, beloved by men, 40 “The Bráhmans, with a system rather cosmogonical than chronological, divide the present mundane period into four ages oryugas as they call them: the Krita, the Tretá, the Dwápara, and the Kali. The Krita, called also the Deva-yuga or that of the Gods, is the age of truth, the perfect age, the Tretá is the age of the three sacred fires, domestic and sacrificial; the Dwápara is the age of doubt; the Kali, the present age, is the age of evil.” G ORRESIO .{FNS

To him whose fame the tale rehearsed He paid his mental worship first; Then with his pupil humbly bent Before the saint most eloquent. Thus honoured and dismissed the seer Departed to his heavenly sphere. Then from his cot Válmíki hied To Tamasá's44 sequestered side, Not far remote from Gangá's tide. He stood and saw the ripples roll Pellucid o'er a pebbly shoal. To Bharadvája45 by his side He turned in ecstasy, and cried: “See, pupil dear, this lovely sight, The smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright, With not a speck or shade to mar, And clear as good men's bosoms are. Here on the brink thy pitcher lay, And bring my zone of bark, I pray. Here will I bathe: the rill has not, To lave the limbs, a fairer spot. Do quickly as I bid, nor waste The precious time; away, and haste.” 44 There are several rivers in India of this name, now corrupted intoTonse. The river here spoken of is that which falls into the Ganges a little below Allahabad. 45 “In Book II, Canto LIV, we meet with a saint of this name presiding over a convent of disciples in his hermitage at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna. Thence the later author of these introductory cantos has borrowed the name and person, inconsistently indeed, but with the intention of enhancing the dignity of the poet by ascribing to him so celebrated a disciple.” SCHLEGEL .{FNS

To spirits and to Gods he made Libation of the stream, and strayed Viewing the forest deep and wide That spread its shade on every side. Close by the bank he saw a pair Of curlews sporting fearless there. But suddenly with evil mind An outcast fowler stole behind, And, with an aim too sure and true, The male bird near the hermit slew. The wretched hen in wild despair With fluttering pinions beat the air, And shrieked a long and bitter cry When low on earth she saw him lie, Her loved companion, quivering, dead, His dear wings with his lifeblood red; And for her golden crested mate She mourned, and was disconsolate. The hermit saw the slaughtered bird, And all his heart with ruth was stirred. The fowler's impious deed distressed His gentle sympathetic breast, And while the curlew's sad cries rang Within his ears, the hermit sang: “No fame be thine for endless time, Because, base outcast, of thy crime, Whose cruel hand was fain to slay

He pondered long upon the speech, Recalled the words and measured each, And thus exclaimed the saintly guide To Bharadvája by his side: “With equal lines of even feet, With rhythm and time and tone complete, The measured form of words I spoke In shock of grief be termed a[loke.”46 And Bharadvája, nothing slow His faithful love and zeal to show, Answered those words of wisdom,“Be The name, my lord, as pleases thee.” As rules prescribe the hermit took Some lustral water from the brook. But still on this his constant thought Kept brooding, as his home he sought; While Bharadvája paced behind, A pupil sage of lowly mind, And in his hand a pitcher bore With pure fresh water brimming o'er. Soon as they reached their calm retreat The holy hermit took his seat; His mind from worldly cares recalled, And mused in deepest thought enthralled. 46 The poet plays upon the similarity in sound of the two words:[oka, means grief,[loka, the heroic measure in which the poem is composed. It need scarcely be said that the derivation is fanciful.
