## Verses to Analyze

### Verse 1 (Ramayana 0.1846)
- **Original**: 1828 The Ramayana “He cleared the earth thrice seven times of the Kshatriya caste, and filled with their blood the five large lakes of Samanta, from which he offered libations to the race of Bhrigu. Offering a solemn sacrifice to the King of the Gods Para[uráma presented the earth to the ministering priests. Having given the earth to Ka [yapa, the hero of immeasurable prowess retired to the Mahen- dra mountain, where he still resides; and in this manner was there enmity between him and the race of the Kshatriyas, and thus was the whole earth conquered by Para[uráma.” The destruction of the Kshatriyas by Para[uráma had been provoked by the cruelty of the Kshatriyas.Chips from a German Workshop,Vol.II. p. 334. The scene in which he appears is probably interpolated for the sake of making him declare Ráma to be VishGu. “Herr von Schlegel has often remarked to me,” says Lassen,“that with- out injuring the connexion of the story all the chapters [of the Rámáyan] might be omitted in which Ráma is regarded as an incarnation of VishGu. In fact, where the incarnation of VishGu as the four sons of Da[aratha is described, the great sacrifice is already ended, and all the priests remunerated at the termination, when the new sacrifice begins at which the Gods appear, then withdraw, and then first propose the incarnation to VishGu. If it[532] had been an original circumstance of the story, the Gods would certainly have deliberated on the matter earlier, and the celebra- tion of the sacrifice would have continued without interruption.” LASSEN ,Indische Alterthumskunde, Vol. I.p. 489.

### Verse 2 (Ramayana 0.1847)
- **Original**: Fate, . 1829 Fate, . “The idea of fate was different in India from that which prevailed in Greece. In Greece fate was a mysterious, inexorable power which governed men and human events, and from which it was impossible to escape. In India Fate was rather an inevitable consequence of actions done in births antecedent to one's present state of existence, and was therefore connected with the doctrine of metempsychosis. A misfortune was for the most part a punish- ment, an expiation of ancient faults not yet entirely cancelled.” G ORRESIO . Visvámitra, . “Though of royal extraction, Vi[vámitra conquered for himself and his family the privileges of a Brahman. He became a Brahman, and thus broke through all the rules of caste. The Brahmans cannot deny the fact, because it forms one of the principal subjects of their legendary poems. But they have spared no pains to represent the exertions of Vi[vámitra, in his struggle for Brahmanhood, as so superhuman that no one would easily be tempted to follow his example. No mention is made of these monstrous penances in the Veda, where the struggle between Vi[vámitra, the leader of the Ku[ikas or Bharatas, and the Brahman Va[ishtha, the leader of the white-robed Tritsus, is represented as the struggle of two rivals for the place of Purohita or chief priest and minister at the court of King Sudás, the son of Pijavana.” Chips from a German Workshop,Vol. II.p. 336.

### Verse 3 (Ramayana 0.1848)
- **Original**: 1830 The Ramayana “No house is supposed to be without its tutelary divinity, but the notion attached to this character is now very far from precise. The deity who is the object of hereditary and family worship, theKuladevatá, is always one of the leading personages of the Hindu mythology, asZiva, VishGu or Durgá, but theGrihadevatá rarely bears any distinct appellation. In Bengal, the domestic god is sometimes theSálagrámstone, sometimes thetulasiplant, sometimes a basket with a little rice in it, and sometimes a water- jar— to either of which a brief adoration is daily addressed, most usually by the females of the family. Occasionally small images of Lakshmi or ChaGdi fulfil the office, or should a snake appear, he is venerated as the guardian of the dwelling. In general, however, in former times, the household deities were regarded as the unseen spirits of ill, the ghosts and goblins who hovered about every spot, and claimed some particular sites as their own. Offerings were made to them in the open air, by scattering a little rice with a short formula at the close of all ceremonies to keep them in good humour. “The household gods correspond better with the genii locorum than with the lares or penates of autiquity.” H.

### Verse 4 (Ramayana 0.1849)
- **Original**: . 1831 The following is a free version of this very ancient story which occurs more than once in theMahábhárat: THE SUPPLIANT D OVE . Chased by a hawk there came a dove With worn and weary wing, And took her stand upon the hand Of Ká[í's mighty king. The monarch smoothed her ruffled plumes And laid her on his breast, And cried,“No fear shall vex thee here, Rest, pretty egg-born, rest! Fair Ká[í's realm is rich and wide, With golden harvests gay, But all that's mine will I resign Ere I my guest betray.” But panting for his half won spoil The hawk was close behind. And with wild cry and eager eye Came swooping down the wind: “This bird,” he cried,“my destined prize, 'Tis not for thee to shield: 'Tis mine by right and toilsome flight O'er hill and dale and field. Hunger and thirst oppress me sore, And I am faint with toil: Thou shouldst not stay a bird of prey Who claims his rightful spoil. They say thou art a glorious king, And justice is thy care: Then justly reign in thy domain, Nor rob the birds of air.” Then cried the king:“A cow or deer For thee shall straightway bleed, Or let a ram or tender lamb

Mine oath forbids me to betray My little twice-born guest: See how she clings with trembling wings To her protector's breast.” “No flesh of lambs,” the hawk replied, “No blood of deer for me; The falcon loves to feed on doves And such is Heaven's decree. But if affection for the dove[534] Thy pitying heart has stirred, Let thine own flesh my maw refresh, Weighed down against the bird.” He carved the flesh from off his side, And threw it in the scale, While women's cries smote on the skies With loud lament and wail. He hacked the flesh from side and arm, From chest and back and thigh, But still above the little dove The monarch's scale stood high. He heaped the scale with piles of flesh, With sinews, blood and skin, And when alone was left him bone He threw himself therein. Then thundered voices through the air; The sky grew black as night; And fever took the earth that shook To see that wondrous sight. The blessed Gods, from every sphere, By Indra led, came nigh: While drum and flute and shell and lute Made music in the sky. They rained immortal chaplets down,

Then God and Seraph, Bard and Nymph Their heavenly voices raised, And a glad throng with dance and song The glorious monarch praised. They set him on a golden car That blazed with many a gem; Then swiftly through the air they flew, And bore him home with them. Thus Ká[í's lord, by noble deed, Won heaven and deathless fame: And when the weak protection seek From thee, do thou the same. Scenes from the Rámáyan, &c. . The ceremonies that attended the consecration of a king (Abhik- shepa lit. Sprinkling over) are fully described in Goldstücker's Dictionary, from which the following extract is made:“The type of the inauguration ceremony as practised at the Epic period may probably be recognized in the history of the inauguration of Ráma , as told in theRámáyana , and in that of the inaugu- ration ofYudhishmhira, as told in theMahábháratha. Neither ceremony is described in these poems with the full detail which[535] is given of the vaidik rite in theAitareya-BráhmaGam ; but the allusion that Ráma was inaugurated byVa[ishmha and the other Bráhmanas in the same manner as Indra by the Vasus… and the observation which is made in some passages that a certain

According to theAyodhyákáG a, on the day preceding the intended inaugu- rationRáma and his wifeSítáheld a fast, and in the night they performed this preliminary rite:Ráma having made his ablu- tions, approached the idol ofNáráyaGa, took a cup of clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes, made a libation of it into the kindled fire, and drank the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity he lay, silent and composed, together withSítá, on a bed of Ku[a-grass, which was spread before the altar of VishGu, until the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At day-break reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he performed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the meantime the town Ayodhyá had assumed a festive appearance and the inau- guration implements had been arranged… golden water-jars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred rivers, tanks, wells, lakes, and from all oceans, honey, curd, clarified butter, fried grain, Ku [a-grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels, and a splendid furious elephant, golden and silver jars, filled with water, covered withUdumbara branches and various lotus flow- ers, besides a white jewelledchourie, a white splendid parasol, a

### Verse 10 (Ramayana 0.1855)
- **Original**: . 1837 “Mythology regards Vritra as a demon or Asur, the implacable enemy of Indra, but this is not the primitive idea contained in the name of Vritra. In the hymns of the Veda Vritra appears to be the thick dark cloud which Indra the God of the firmament attacks and disperses with his thunderbolt.” G ORRESIO . “In that class of Rig-veda hymns which there is reason to look upon as the oldest portion of Vedic poetry, the character of Indra is that of a mighty ruler of the firmament, and his principal feat is that of conquering the demonVritra, a symbolical personifi- cation of the cloud which obstructs the clearness of the sky, and withholds the fructifying rain from the earth. In his battles with Vritra he is therefore described as‘opening the receptacles of the waters,’ as ‘cleaving the cloud’ with his‘far-whirling thunder- bolt,’ as ‘casting the waters down to earth,’ and ‘restoring the sun to the sky.’ He is in consequence‘the upholder of heaven, earth, and firmament,’and the god‘who has engendered the sun and the dawn.’ ”C HAMBERS 'S C YCLOPÆDIA ,Indra. “Throughout these hymns two images stand out before us with overpowering distinctness. On one side is the bright god of the heaven, as beneficent as he is irresistible: on the other the demon of night and of darkness, as false and treachorous as he is malignant.… The latter (as his name Vritra, from var, to veil, indicates) is pre-eminently the thief who hides away the rain- clouds.… But the myth is yet in too early a state to allow of the definite designations which are brought before us in the conflicts of Zeus with Typhôn and his monstrous progeny, of Apollôn with the Pythôn, of Bellerophôn with Chimaira of Oidipous with the Sphinx, of Hercules with Cacus, of Sigurd with the dragon Fafnir; and thus not only is Vritra known by many names, but he is opposed sometimes by Indra, sometimes by Agni the fire-god, sometimes by Trita, Brihaspati, or other deities; or rather these are all names of one and the same god.” C OX 'S Mythology of the Aryan Nations.

### Verse 12 (Ramayana 0.1857)
- **Original**: . 1839 The following account of the origin of the Nishádas is taken from Wilson'sVishGu PuráGa, Book I. Chap. 15.“Afterwards the Munis beheld a great dust arise, and they said to the people who were nigh:‘What is this?’ And the people answered and said:‘Now that the kingdom is without a king, the dishonest men have begun to seize the property of their neighbours. The great dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of clustering robbers, hastening to fall upon their prey.’The sages, hearing this, consulted, and together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had left no offspring, to produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came forth a being of the complexion of a charred stake, with flattened features like a negro, and of dwarfish stature.‘What am I to do,’ cried he eagerly to the Munis.‘Sit down (nishída),’said they. And thence his name was Nisháda. His descendants, the inhabitants of the Vindhyá moun- tain, great Muni, are still called Nishádas and are characterized by the exterior tokens of depravity.” Professor Wilson adds, in his note on the passage:“The Matsya says that there were born outcast or barbarous races, Mlechchhas, as black as collyrium. The Bhágavata describes an individual of dwarfish stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion as black as a crow, with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and tawny hair, whose descendants were mountaineers and foresters. The Padma (Bhú- mi KhaG a) has a similar deccription; adding to the dwarfish stature and black complexion, a wide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly. It also particularizes his posterity as Nishádas, Kirátas, Bhillas, and other barbarians and Mlechchhas, living in woods and on mountains. These passages intend, and do not much exaggerate, the uncouth appearance of the Gonds, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes, scattered along the forests and mountains of Central India from Behar to Khandesh, and who are, not improbably, the predecessors of the present occupants of the cultivated portions of the country.

Thy hand has made no Bráhman bleed. “The punishment which the Code of Manu awards to the slayer of a Brahman was to be branded in the forehead with the mark of a headless corpse, and entirely banished from society; this being apparently commutable for a fine. The poem is there- fore in accordance with the Code regarding the peculiar guilt of killing Brahmans; but in allowing a hermit who was not a Divija(twice-born) to go to heaven, the poem is far in advance of the Code. The youth in the poem is allowed to read the Veda, and to accumulate merit by his own as well as his father's pious acts; whereas the exclusive Code reserves all such privileges to Divijasinvested with the sacred cord.” Mrs. SPEIR 'S Life in Ancient India, p. 107. .

And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

That taken by the envoys appears to have been the shorter one, and we are not told why Bharat returned by a differ- ent road. The capital of the Kekayas lay to the west of the Vipá[á. Between it and theZatadru stretched the country of the Báhíkas. Upon the remaining portion of the road the two recensions differ. According to that of Bengal there follow towards the east the river Indamatí, then the town Ajakála belonging to the Bodhi, then Bhulingá, then the riverZaradaG á. According to the other instead of the first river comes the Ikshumatí… instead of the first town Abhikála, instead of the second Kulingá, then the second river. According to the direction of the route both the above-mentioned rivers must be tributaries of theZatadrú.… The road then crossed the Yamuná (Jumna), led beyond that river through the country of the Panchálas, and reached the Ganges at Hástinapura, where the ferry was. Thence it led over the Rámagangá and its eastern tributaries, then over the Gomati, and then in a southern direction along the Málini, beyond which it reached Ayodhyá. In Bharat's journey the following rivers are passed from west to east:Kutikoshmiká,Uttániká,Ku miká,Kapí- vatí,Gomatí according to Schlegel, andHiraGyavatí,Uttáriká, Ku milá,Kapívatí,Gomatí according to Gorresio.

At the same time, however, the story throws some light upon the significance of the poem, and upon the character in which the Brahmanical author desired to represent Ráma; and consequently it deserves more serious consideration than the nature of the subject-matter would otherwise seem to imply. “According to the Rámáyana, the hero Ráma spent more than thirteen years of his exile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements, which appear to have been scattered over the country between the Ganges and the Godáveri; his wan- derings extending from the hill of Chitra-kúma in Bundelkund, to the modern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near the source of the Godáveri river, and about seventy-five miles to the north-west of Bombay. The appearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in the country far away to the south of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for critical inquiry. Each hermitage is said to have belonged to some particular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical tradition. But whether the sages named were really contemporaries of Ráma, or whether they could possibly have flourished at one and the same period, is open to serious question. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of certainty the relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have been visited by Ráma; but still it seems tolerably clear that some
