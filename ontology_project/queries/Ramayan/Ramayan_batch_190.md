## Verses to Analyze

### Verse 1 (Ramayana 0.1826)
- **Original**: 1808 The Ramayana who there perform their rigid austerities and live on roots and berries. This is my chief desire, to stand within the hermits' grove were it but for a single day.” And Ráma said:“Let not the thought trouble thee: thou shalt go to the grove of the ascetics.” But slanderous tongues have been busy in Ayodhyá, and Sítá has not been spared. Ráma hears that the people are lamenting his blind folly in taking back to his bosom the wife who was so long a captive in the palace of RávaG. Ráma well knows her spotless purity in thought, word, and deed, and her perfect love of him; but he cannot endure the mockery and the shame and resolves to abandon his unsuspecting wife. He orders the sad but still obedient LakshmaG to convey her to the hermitage which she wishes to visit and to leave her there, for he will see her face again no more. They arrive at the hermitage, and LakshmaG tells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and when she recovers her consciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her cruel and undeserved lot. But she resolves to live for the sake of Ráma and her unborn son, and she sends by LakshmaG a dignified message to the husband who has forsaken her:“I grieve not for myself,” she says“because I have been abandoned on account of what the people say, and not for any evil that I have done. The husband is the God of the wife, the husband is her lord and guide; and what seems good unto him she should do even at the cost of her life.” Sítá is honourably received by the saint Válmíki himself, and the holy women of the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this calm retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of Ku[a and Lava. They are carefully brought up and are taught by Válmíki himself to recite the RámáyaG. The years pass by: and Ráma at length determines to celebrate the A[vamedha or Sacrifice of the Steed. Válmíki, with his two young pupils, attends the ceremony, and the unknown princes recite before the delighted father the poem which recounts his deeds. Ráma inquires into their history and recognizes them

Sítá is invited to return and solemnly affirm her innocence before the great assembly. “But Sítá's heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her power to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of women when he ventured to paint her conscious[520] purity as rebelling:‘Beholding all the spectators, and clothed in red garments, Sítá clasping her hands and bending low her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with tears:“as I, even in mind, have never thought of any other than Ráma, so may Mádhaví the goddess of Earth, grant me a hiding-place.” As Sítá made this oath, lo! a marvel appeared. Suddenly cleaving the earth, a divine throne of marvellous beauty rose up, borne by resplendent dragons on their heads: and seated on it, the goddess of Earth, raising Sítá with her arm, said to her,“Welcome to thee!” and placed her by her side. And as the queen, seated on the throne, slowly descended to Hades, a continuous shower of flowers fell down from heaven on her head.’1035” “Both the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In theMahábhárata the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly won throne to die one by one in a forlorn pilgrimage to the Himálaya; and in the same way Ráma only regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is the same in the later Homeric cycle— the heroes of theIliadperish by ill-fated deaths. And even Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail again to Thesprotia, and finally falls by the hand of his own son. But in India and Greece alike this is an afterthought of a self-conscious time, which has been subsequently added to cast a gloom on the strong cheerfulness of the heroic age.”1036 “The termination of Ráma's terrestrial career is thus told in Sections 116 ff. of the UttarakáGda. Time, in the form of an ascetic, comes to his palace gate, and asks, as the messenger 1035 E. B. Cowell.Academy , No. 43.

### Verse 3 (Ramayana 0.1828)
- **Original**: 1810 The Ramayana of the great rishi (Brahmá) to see Ráma. He is admitted and received with honour, but says, when he is asked what he has to communicate, that his message must be delivered in private, and that any one who witnesses the interview is to lose his life. Ráma informs LakshmaG of all this, and desires him to stand outside. Time then tells Ráma that he has been sent by Brahmá, to say that when he (Ráma,i.e.VishGu) after destroying the worlds was sleeping on the ocean, he had formed him (Brahmá) from the lotus springing from his navel, and committed to him the work of creation; that he (Brahmá) had then entreated Ráma to assume the function of Preserver, and that the latter had in consequence become VishGu, being born as the son of Aditi, and had determined to deliver mankind by destroying RávaGa, and to live on earth ten thousand and ten hundred years; that period, adds Time, was now on the eve of expiration, and Ráma could either at his pleasure prolong his stay on earth, or ascend to heaven and rule over the gods. Ráma replies, that he had been born for the good of the three worlds, and would now return to the place whence he had come, as it was his function to fulfil the purposes of the gods. While they are speaking the irritable rishi Durvásas comes, and insists on seeing Ráma immediately, under a threat, if refused, of cursing Ráma and all his family.” Lakshma G, preferring to save his kinsman, though knowing that his own death must be the consequence of interrupting the interview of Ráma with Time, enters the palace and reports the rishi's message to Ráma. Ráma comes out, and when Durvásas[521] has got the food he wished, and departed, Ráma reflects with great distress on the words of Time, which require that LakshmaG should die. LakshmaG however exhorts Ráma not to grieve, but to abandon him and not break his own promise. The counsellors concurring in this advice, Ráma abandons LakshmaG, who goes to the river Sarayú, suppresses all his senses, and is conveyed bodily by Indra to heaven. The gods are delighted by the arrival of the fourth part of VishGu. Ráma then resolves to install

Ráma's subjects are filled with grief, and say they also will follow him wherever he goes. Messengers are sent toZatrughna, the other brother, and he also resolves to accompany Ráma; who at length sets out in procession from his capital with all the ceremonial appropriate to the“great departure,” silent, indifferent to external objects, joyless, with Zrí on his right, the goddess Earth on his left, Energy in front, attended by all his weapons in human shapes, by the Vedas in the forms of Bráhmans, by the Gáyatrí, the Omkára, the Vashamkára, by rishis, by his women, female slaves, eunuchs, and servants. Bharata with his family, andZatrughna, follow together with Bráhmans bearing the sacred fire, and the whole of the people of the country, and even with animals, etc., etc. Ráma, with all these attendants, comes to the banks of the Sarayú. Brahmá, with all the gods and innumerable celestial cars, now appears, and all the sky is refulgent with the divine splendour. Pure and fragrant breezes blow, a shower of flowers falls. Ráma enters the waters of the Sarayú; and Brahmá utters a voice from the sky, saying: “Approach, VishGu; Rághava, thou hast happily arrived, with thy godlike brothers. Enter thine own body as VishGu or the eternal ether. For thou art the abode of the worlds: no one comprehends thee, the inconceivable and imperishable, except the large-eyed Máyá thy primeval spouse.” Hearing these words, Ráma enters the glory of VishGu with his body and his followers. He then asks Brahmá to find an abode for the people who had accompanied him from devotion to his person, and Brahmá appoints them a celestial residence accordingly.1037 [522] 1037 M UIR {FNS ,Sanskrit Texts, Part IV., Appendix.

Queen Fortune. “A curious festival is celebrated in honour of this divinity (Lak- shmî) on the fifth lunar day of the light half of the month Mâgha (February), when she is identified with Saraswatí the consort of Brahmá, and the goddess of learning. In his treatise on festivals, a great modern authority, Raghunandana, mentions, on the faith of a work calledSamvatsara-sandipa, that Lakshmî is to be worshipped in the forenoon of that day with flowers, perfumes, rice, and water; that due honour is to be paid to inkstand and writing-reed, and no writing to be done. Wilson, in his essay on theReligious Festivals of the Hindus(works, vol. ii, p. 188. ff.) adds that on the morning of the 2nd February, the whole of the pens and inkstands, and the books, if not too numerous and bulky, are collected, the pens or reeds cleaned, the inkstands scoured, and the books wrapped up in new cloth, are arranged upon a platform, or a sheet, and strewn over with flowers and blades of young barley, and that no flowers except white are to be offered. After performing the necessary rites,… all the members of the family assemble and make their prostrations; the books, the pens, and ink having an entire holiday; and should any emergency require a written communication on the day dedicated to the divinity of scholarship, it is done with chalk or charcoal upon a black or white board.” C HAMBERS 'S ENCYCLOPÆDIA .Lakshmî.

### Verse 7 (Ramayana 0.1832)
- **Original**: 1814 The Ramayana “1. The Matsya, or fish. In this avatár VishGu descended in the form of a fish to save the pious king Satyavrata, who with the seven Rishis and their wives had taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then destroyed the earth. 2, The Kúrma, or Tortoise. In this he descended in the form of a tortoise, for the purpose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost during the flood. To this end he stationed himself at the bottom of the ocean, and allowed the point of the great mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back, which served as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons, with the serpent Vásuki twisted round the mountain for a rope, churned the waters for the recovery of the amrita or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things. 3. The Varáha, or Boar. In this he descended in the form of a boar to rescue the earth from the power of a demon called‘golden-eyed,’ HiraGyáksha. This demon had seized on the earth and carried it with him into the depths of the ocean. VishGu dived into the abyss, and after a contest of a thousand years slew the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or Man-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion, VishGu delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent demon called HiraGyaka[ipu. 5. Vámana, or Dwarf. This avatár happened in the second age of the Hindús or Tretáyug, the four preceding are said to have occurred in the first or Satyayug; the object of this avatár was to trick Bali out of the dominion of the three worlds. Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he appeared before the king and asked, as a boon, as much land as he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and VishGu immediately expanding himself till he filled the world, deprived Bali at two steps of heaven and earth, but in consideration of some merit, left Pátála still in his dominion. 6. Para[uráma. 7. Rámchandra. 8. KrishGa, or according to some Balaráma. 9. Buddha. In this avatár VishGu descended in the form of a sage for the purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins, and especially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice.

VishGu mounted on a white horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will, according to prophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or Kaliyug, by destroying the world, and then renovating creation by an age of purity.” W ILLIAM 'S D ICTIONARY .VishGu. Siva. “A celebrated Hindú God, the Destroyer of creation, and there- fore the most formidable of the Hindú Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the Hindú philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without subsequent regeneration. Hence he is sometimes confounded with Brahmá, the creator or first person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the Tántrikas, or fol- lowers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are termed Zaivas, and although not so numerous as the VaishGavas, exalt their god to the highest place in the heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes which properly belong to the other deities. According to themZiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin probably of the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As the God of generation and justice, which latter character he shares with the god Yama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied purity of Justice. His throat is dark-blue; his hair of a light[524] reddish colour, and thickly matted together, and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic. He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing

He holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to water, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time, he not only presides over its extinction, but also its astronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of time by the phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote the measure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and succession of the generations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound in his hair, round his neck, wrists, waist, arms and legs; they serve as rings for his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant companions.Ziva has more than a thousand names which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth chapter of theZiva PuráGa.”— W ILLIAMS 'S D ICTIONARY ,Ziva. Apsarases. “Originally these deities seem to have been personifications of the vapours which are attracted by the sun, and form into mist or clouds: their character may be thus interpreted in the few hymns of the Rigveda where mention is made of them. At a subsequent period when the Gandharva of the Rigveda who personifies there especially the Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning, the rays of the moon and other attributes of the elementary life of heaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena or objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated

Vishnu's Incarnation As Ráma. “Here is described one of theavatárs, descents or manifestations of VishGu in a visible form. The wordavatársignifies literally descent. The avatárwhich is here spoken of, that in which, according to Indian traditions, VishGu descended and appeared[525] upon earth in the corporeal form of Ráma, the hero of the Rámáyana, is the seventh in the series of Indianavatárs. Much has been said before now of these avatárs, and through deficient knowledge of the ideas and doctrines of India, they have been compared to the sublime dogma of the Christian Incarnation. This is one of the grossest errors that ignorance of the ideas and beliefs of a people has produced. Between theavatársof India and the Christian Incarnation there is such an immensity

### Verse 11 (Ramayana 0.1836)
- **Original**: 1818 The Ramayana of difference that it is impossible to find any reasonable analogy that can approximate them. The idea of theavatársis intimately united with that of the Trimúrti; the bond of connection be- tween these two ideas is an essential notion common to both, the notion of VishGu. What is the Trimúrti? I have already said that it is composed of three Gods, Brahmá (masculine), VishGu the God ofavatárs, andZiva. These three Gods, who when reduced to their primitive and most simple expression are but three cosmogonical personifications, three powers or forces of nature, these Gods, I say, are here found, according to Indian doctrines, entirely external to the true God of India, or Brahma in the neuter gender. Brahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of creation: all emanates from him, he comprehends all, but he remains extraneous to all: he is Being and the negation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped; the indeterminate Being is never invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as the actions of man; humanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him. External to Brahma rises the Trimúrti, that is to say, Brahmá (masculine) the power which creates, VishGu the power which preserves, and Ziva the power which destroys: theogony here commences at the same time with cosmogony. The three divinities of the Trimúrti govern the phenomena of the universe and influence all nature. The real God of India is by himself without power; real efficacious power is attributed only to three divinities who exist externally to him. Brahmá, VishGu, andZiva, possessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes that are mutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which re- sults from the power of things itself, and which is found external to their own thoughts. Such is the Indian Trimúrti. What an immense difference between this Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity! Here there is only one God, who created all, provides for all, governs all. He exists in three Persons equal to one another, and intimately united in one only infinite and eternal substance. The Father represents the eternal thought and

This one and triune God completes by omnipotent power the great work of creation which, when it has come forth from His hands, proceeds in obedience to the laws which He has given it, governed with certain order by His infinite providence. “The immense difference between the Trimúrti of India and the Christian Trinity is found again between theavatársof VishGu and the Incarnation of Christ. Theavatárwas effected altogether externally to the Being who is in India regarded as the true God. The manifestation of one essentially cosmogonical divinity wrought for the most part only material and cosmogonical prodi- gies. At one time it takes the form of the gigantic tortoise which sustains Mount Mandar from sinking in the ocean; at another of the fish which raises the lost Veda from the bottom of the sea, and saves mankind from the waters. When theseavatársare not cosmogonical they consist in some protection accorded to men[526] or Gods, a protection which is neither universal nor permanent. The very manner in which theavatáris effected corresponds to its material nature, for instance the mysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which theavatárhere spoken of takes place. What are the forms which VishGu takes in his descents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a boar, a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and liberty, that is to say, the form of man. In theavatárof VishGu is discovered the inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less prevailed in India. Does theavatárproduce a permanent and definitive result in the world? By no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe either of nature or man, and its effects are only transitory.… To sum up then, the Indianavatár is effected externally to the true God of India, to Brahma; it has only a cosmogonical or historical mission which is neither lasting nor decisive; it is accomplished by means of strange prodigies and magic transformations; it may assume promiscuously all the

### Verse 13 (Ramayana 0.1838)
- **Original**: 1820 The Ramayana forms of life; it may be repeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this Indian idea taken from primitive tradition be compared with the Incarnation of Christ and it will be seen that there is between the two an irreconcilable difference. According to the doctrines of Christianity the Everlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of God, and equal to Him, assumed a human body, and being born as a man accomplished by his divine act the great miracle of the spiritual redemption of man. His coming had for its sole object to bring erring and lost humanity back to Him; this work being accomplished, and the divine union of men with God being re-established, redemption is complete and remains eternal. “The superficial study of India produced in the last century many erroneous ideas, many imaginary and false parallels be- tween Christianity and the Brahmanical religion. A profounder knowledge of Indian civilization and religion, and philological studies enlarged and guided by more certain principles have dissipated one by one all those errors. The attributes of the Chris- tian God, which by one of those intellectual errors, which Vico attributes to the vanity of the learned, had been transferred to VishGu, have by a better inspired philosophy been reclaimed for Christianity, and the result of the two religions, one immovable and powerless, the other diffusing itself with all its inherent force and energy, has shown further that there is a difference, a real opposition, between the two principles.”— G ORRESIO .

It chanced, one evening, from a lofty seat He viewed Ayodhyá stretched before his feet: He looked with pride upon the royal road Lined with gay shops their glittering stores that showed, He looked on Sarjú's silver waves, that bore The light barks flying with the sail and oar; He saw the gardens near the town that lay, Filled with glad citizens and boys at play. Then swelled the monarch's bosom with delight, And his heart triumphed at the happy sight. He turned to Bhadra, standing by his side,— Upon whose secret news the king relied.— And bade him say what people said and thought Of all the exploits that his arm had wrought. The spy was silent, but, when questioned still, Thus spake, obedient to his master's will: “For all thy deeds in peace and battle done The people praise thee, King, except for one: This only act of all thy life they blame,— Thy welcome home of her, thy ravished dame.”

But rigid Duty left no choice between His perilled honour and his darling queen. Called to his side, his brothers wept to trace The marks of anguish in his altered face. No longer bright and glorious as of old, He thus addressed them when the tale was told: “Alas! my brothers, that my life should blot The fame of those the Sun himself begot: As from the labouring cloud the driven rain Leaves on the mirror's polished face a stain. E'en as an elephant who loathes the stake And the strong chain he has no power to break, I cannot brook this cry on every side, That spreads like oil upon the moving tide. I leave the daughter of Videha's King, And the fair blossom soon from her to spring,[528] As erst, obedient to my sire's command, I left the empire of the sea-girt land. Good is my queen, and spotless; but the blame Is hard to bear, the mockery and the shame. Men blame the pure Moon for the darkened ray, When the black shadow takes the light away. And, O my brothers, if ye wish to see Ráma live long from this reproach set free, Let not your pity labour to control The firm sad purpose of his changeless soul.”

She mounted up: Sumantra held the reins; And forth the coursers bounded o'er the plains. She saw green fields in all their beauty dressed, And thanked her husband in her loving breast. Alas! deluded queen! she little knew How changed was he whom she believed so true; How one she worshipped like the Heavenly Tree Could, in a moment's time, so deadly be. Her right eye throbbed,— ill-omened sign, to tell The endless loss of him she loved so well, And to the lady's saddening heart revealed The woe that LakshmaG, in his love, concealed. Pale grew the bloom of her sweet face,— as fade The lotus blossoms,— by that sign dismayed. “Oh, may this omen,”— was her silent prayer,— “No grief to Ráma or his brothers bear!”

At length with sobs and burning tears that rolled Down his sad face, the king's command he told; As when a monstrous cloud, in evil hour,[529] Rains from its labouring womb a stony shower. She heard, she swooned, she fell upon the earth, Fell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth. As, when the tempest in its fury flies, Low in the dust the prostrate creeper lies, So, struck with terror sank she on the ground, And all her gems, like flowers, lay scattered round. But Earth, her mother, closed her stony breast, And, filled with doubt, denied her daughter rest. She would not think the Chief of Raghu's race Would thus his own dear guiltless wife disgrace. Stunned and unconscious, long the lady lay, And felt no grief, her senses all astray. But gentle LakshmaG, with a brother's care, Brought back her sense, and with her sense, despair. But not her wrongs, her shame, her grief, could wring One angry word against her lord the King: Upon herself alone the blame she laid, For tears and sighs that would not yet be stayed. To soothe her anguish LakshmaG gently strove; He showed the path to Saint Válmíki's grove; And craved her pardon for the share of ill He wrought, obedient to his brother's will. “O, long and happy, dearest brother, live! I have to praise,” she cried,“and not forgive: To do his will should be thy noblest praise; As VishGu ever Indra's will obeys.

### Verse 18 (Ramayana 0.1843)
- **Original**: Kusa and Lava. 1825 Return, dear brother: on each royal dame Bestow a blessing in poor Sítá's name, And bid them, in their love, kind pity take Upon her offspring, for the father's sake. And speak my message in the monarch's ear, The last last words of mine that he shall hear: “Say, was it worthy of thy noble race Thy guiltless queen thus lightly to disgrace? For idle tales to spurn thy faithful bride, Whose constant truth the searching fire had tried? Or may I hope thy soul refused consent, And but thy voice decreed my banishment? Hope that no care could turn, no love could stay The lightning stroke that falls on me to-day? That sins committed in the life that's fled Have brought this evil on my guilty head? Think not I value now my widowed life, Worthless to her who once was Ráma's wife. I only live because I hope to see The dear dear babe that will resemble thee. And then my task of penance shall be done, [530] With eyes uplifted to the scorching sun; So shall the life that is to come restore Mine own dear husband, to be lost no more.” And Lakshma G swore her every word to tell, Then turned to go, and bade the queen farewell. Alone with all her woes, her piteous cries Rose like a butchered lamb's that struggling dies. The reverend sage who from his dwelling came For sacred grass and wood to feed the flame, Heard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood, And, quickly following, by the mourner stood. Before the sage the lady bent her low, Dried her poor eyes, and strove to calm her woe.

### Verse 19 (Ramayana 0.1844)
- **Original**: 1826 The Ramayana With blessings on her hopes the blameless man In silver tones his soothing speech began: “First of all faithful wives, O Queen, art thou; And can I fail to mourn thy sorrows now? Rest in this holy grove, nor harbour fear Where dwell in safety e'en the timid deer. Here shall thine offspring safely see the light, And be partaker of each holy rite. Here, near the hermits' dwellings, shall thou lave Thy limbs in Tonse's sin-destroying wave, And on her isles, by prayer and worship, gain Sweet peace of mind, and rest from care and pain. Each hermit maiden with her sweet soft voice, Shall soothe thy woe, and bid thy heart rejoice: With fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill, And offer grain that springs for us at will. And here, with labour light, thy task shall be To water carefully each tender tree, And learn how sweet a nursing mother's joy Ere on thy bosom rest thy darling boy.…” That very night the banished Sítá bare Two royal children, most divinely fair.… The saint Válmíki, with a friend's delight, Graced Sítá's offspring with each holy rite. Ku [a and Lava— such the names they bore— Learnt, e'en in childhood, all the Vedas' lore; And then the bard, their minstrel souls to train, Taught them to sing his own immortal strain. And Ráma's deeds her boys so sweetly sang, That Sítá's breast forgot her bitterest pang.…

### Verse 20 (Ramayana 0.1845)
- **Original**: Parasuráma, . 1827 [531] Then Sítá's children, by the saint's command, Sang the Rámáyan, wandering through the land. How could the glorious poem fail to gain Each heart, each ear that listened to the strain! So sweet each minstrel's voice who sang the praise Of Ráma deathless in Válmíki's lays. Ráma himself amid the wondering throng Marked their fair forms, and loved the noble song, While, still and weeping, round the nobles stood, As, on a windless morn, a dewy wood. On the two minstrels all the people gazed, Praised their fair looks and marvelled as they praised; For every eye amid the throng could trace Ráma's own image in each youthful face. Then spoke the king himself and bade them say Who was their teacher, whose the wondrous lay. Soon as Válmíki, mighty saint, he saw, He bowed his head in reverential awe. “These are thy children” cried the saint,“recall Thine own dear Sítá, pure and true through all.” “O holy father,” thus the king replied, “The faithful lady by the fire was tried; But the foul demon's too successful arts Raised light suspicions in my people's hearts. Grant that their breasts may doubt her faith no more, And thus my Sítá and her sons restore.” RaghuvaG[a Cantos XIV, XV. Parasuráma, .
