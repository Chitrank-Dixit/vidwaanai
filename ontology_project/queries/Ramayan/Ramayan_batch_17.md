## Verses to Analyze

### Verse 1 (Ramayan 0.321)
- **Original**: Canto I. The Heir Apparent. 303 In art and science duly trained, His student vow he well maintained; He learnt the lore for princes fit, The Vedas and their Holy Writ, And with his well-drawn bow at last His mighty father's fame surpassed. Of birth exalted, truthful, just, With vigorous hand, with noble trust, Well taught by aged twice-born men Who gain and right could clearly ken, Full well the claims and bounds he knew Of duty, gain, and pleasure too: Of memory keen, of ready tact, In civil business prompt to act. Reserved, his features ne'er disclosed What counsel in his heart reposed. All idle rage and mirth controlled, He knew the times to give and hold, Firm in his faith, of steadfast will, He sought no wrong, he spoke no ill: Not rashly swift, not idly slow, His faults and others' keen to know. Each merit, by his subtle sense; He matched with proper recompense. He knew the means that wealth provide, And with keen eye expense could guide. Wild elephants could he reclaim, And mettled steeds could mount and tame. No arm like his the bow could wield, Or drive the chariot to the field. Skilled to attack, to deal the blow, Or lead a host against the foe: Yea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear To meet his arm in full career.

### Verse 2 (Ramayan 0.322)
- **Original**: 304 The Ramayana As the great sun in noontide blaze Is glorious with his world of rays, So Ráma with these virtues shone Which all men loved to gaze upon. The aged monarch fain would rest, And said within his weary breast, “Oh that I might, while living yet, My Ráma o'er the kingdom set. And see, before my course be run, The hallowed drops anoint my son; See all this spacious land obey, From side to side, my first-born's sway, And then, my life and joy complete, Obtain in heaven a blissful seat!” In him the monarch saw combined The fairest form, the noblest mind, And counselled how his son might share, The throne with him as Regent Heir. For fearful signs in earth and sky, And weakness warned him death was nigh: But Ráma to the world endeared By every grace his bosom cheered,[090] The moon of every eye, whose ray Drove all his grief and fear away. So duty urged that hour to seize, Himself, his realm, to bless and please. From town and country, far and near, He summoned people, prince, and peer. To each he gave a meet abode, And honoured all and gifts bestowed. Then, splendid in his king's attire, He viewed them, as the general Sire,

### Verse 3 (Ramayan 0.323)
- **Original**: Canto II. The People's Speech. 305 In glory of a God arrayed, Looks on the creatures he has made. But Kekaya's king he called not then For haste, nor Janak, lord of men; For after to each royal friend The joyful tidings he would send. Mid crowds from distant countries met The king upon his throne was set; Then honoured by the people, all The rulers thronged into the hall. On thrones assigned, each king in place Looked silent on the monarch's face. Then girt by lords of high renown And throngs from hamlet and from town He showed in regal pride, As, honoured by the radiant band Of blessed Gods that round him stand, Lord Indra, Thousand-eyed. Canto II. The People's Speech. Then to the full assembly bowed The monarch, and addressed the crowd With gracious speech, in accents loud As heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:

### Verse 4 (Ramayan 0.324)
- **Original**: 306 The Ramayana “Needs not to you who know declare How ever with paternal care My fathers of Ikshváku's line Have ruled the realm which now is mine. I too have taught my feet to tread The pathway of the mighty dead, And with fond care that never slept Have, as I could, my people kept. So toiling still, and ne'er remiss For all my people's weal and bliss, Beneath the white umbrella's260 shade. Old age is come and strength decayed. Thousands of years have o'er me flown, And generations round me grown And passed away. I crave at length Repose and ease for broken strength. Feeble and worn I scarce can bear The ruler's toil, the judge's care, With royal dignity, a weight That tries the young and temperate. I long to rest, my labour done, And in my place to set my son, If to the twice-born gathered here My counsel wise and good appear. For greater gifts than mine adorn Ráma my son, my eldest-born. Like Indra brave, before him fall The foeman's cities, tower and wall. Him prince of men for power and might, The best maintainer of the right, Fair as the moon when nothing bars His glory close to Pushya's stars, 260 Chief of the insignia of imperial dignity.

### Verse 5 (Ramayan 0.325)
- **Original**: Canto II. The People's Speech. 307 Him with to-morrow's light I fain Would throne the consort of my reign. A worthy lord for you, I ween, Marked as her own by Fortune's Queen. The triple world itself would be Well ruled by such a king as he. To such high bliss and happy fate Will I the country dedicate, And my sad heart will cease to grieve If he the precious charge receive. Thus is my careful plan matured, Thus for myself is rest secured; Lieges, approve the words I say, Or point ye out some wiser way. Devise your prudent plan. My mind Is fondly to this thought inclined, But men by keen debating move Some middle course which all approve.” The monarch ceased. In answer came The joyous princes' glad acclaim. So peacocks in the rain rejoice And hail the cloud with lifted voice. Murmurs of joy from thousands round Shook the high palace with the sound. Then when the gathered throng had learned His will who right and gain discerned, Peasant and townsman, priest and chief, All met in consultation brief, And soon agreed with one accord Gave answer to their sovereign lord: “King of the land, we know thee old: Thousands of years have o'er thee rolled, Ráma thy son, we pray, anoint,

### Verse 6 (Ramayan 0.326)
- **Original**: 308 The Ramayana And at thy side his place appoint Our gallant prince, so brave and strong, Riding in royal state along, Our eyes with joyful pride will see Screened by the shade that shelters thee.” Then spake the king again, as though Their hearts' true wish he sought to know: “These prayers for Ráma's rule suggest One question to my doubting breast. This thing, I pray, with truth explain: Why would ye, while I justly reign, That he, mine eldest son, should bear His part with me as ruling heir?” Then all the people made reply, Peasant and townsman, low and high: “Each noblest gift of form and mind,[091] O Monarch, in thy son we find. Do thou the godlike virtues hear Which Ráma to our hearts endear. So richly blest with graces, none In all the earth excels thy son: Nay, who to match with him may claim In truth, in justice, and in fame? True to his promise, gentle, kind, Unenvious, of grateful mind, Versed in the law and firm of soul, He keeps each sense with strict control. With duteous care he loves to sit By Bráhmans skilled in Holy Writ. Hence brightest glory, ne'er to end, And matchless fame his youth attend. Skilled in the use of spear and shield, And arms which heavenly warriors wield, Supreme in war, unconquered yet

### Verse 7 (Ramayan 0.327)
- **Original**: Canto II. The People's Speech. 309 By man, fiend, God in battle met, Whene'er in pomp of war he goes 'Gainst town or city of the foes, He ever comes with LakshmaG back Victorious from the fierce attack. Returning homeward from afar Borne on his elephant or car, He ever to the townsmen bends And greets them as beloved friends, Asks how each son, each servant thrives, How fare our pupils, offerings, wives; And like a father bids us tell, Each for himself, that all is well. If pain or grief the city tries His heart is swift to sympathize. When festive scenes our thoughts employ He like a father shares the joy. High is the fate, O King, that gave Thy Ráma born to bless and save, With filial virtues fair and mild Like Ka[yap old Maríchi's child. Hence to the kingdom's distant ends One general prayer for him ascends. Each man in town and country prays For Ráma's strength, health, length of days. With hearts sincere, their wish the same, The tender girl, the aged dame, Subject and stranger, peasant, hind, One thought impressed on every mind, At evening and at dawning day To all the Gods for Ráma pray. Do thou, O King, of grace comply, And hear the people's longing cry, And let us on the throne by thee

O thou who givest boons, attend; A gracious ear, O Monarch, lend And for our weal install, Consenting to our earnest prayer, Thy godlike Ráma Regent Heir, Who seeks the good of all.” Canto III. Dasaratha's Precepts. The monarch with the prayer complied Of suppliant hands, on every side Uplifted like a lotus-bed: And then these gracious words he said: “Great joy and mighty fame are mine Because your loving hearts incline, In full assembly clearly shown To place my Ráma on the throne.” Then to Va[ishmha, standing near, And Vámadeva loud and clear The monarch spoke that all might hear: “'Tis pure and lovely Chaitra now When flowers are sweet on every bough; All needful things with haste prepare That Ráma be appointed heir.”

This day let all things ready wait Mine eldest son to consecrate.” Best of all men of second birth Va [ishmha heard the lord of earth, And gave commandment to the bands Of servitors with lifted hands Who waited on their master's eye: “Now by to-morrow's dawn supply Rich gold and herbs and gems of price And offerings for the sacrifice, Wreaths of white flowers and roasted rice, And oil and honey, separate; New garments and a car of state, An elephant with lucky signs, A fourfold host in ordered lines, The white umbrella, and a pair Of chowries,261 and a banner fair; A hundred vases, row on row, To shine like fire in splendid glow, A tiger's mighty skin, a bull With gilded horns most beautiful. All these, at dawn of coming day, Around the royal shrine array, Where burns the fire's undying ray. Each palace door, each city gate With wreaths of sandal decorate. 261 Whisks, usually made of the long tails of the Yak.

Let food of noble kind and taste Be for a hundred thousand placed; Fresh curds with streams of milk bedewed To feed the Bráhman multitude.[092] With care be all their wants supplied. And mid the twice-born chiefs divide Rich largess, with the early morn, And oil and curds and roasted corn. Soon as the sun has shown his light Pronounce the prayer to bless the rite, And then be all the Bráhmans called And in their ordered seats installed. Let all musicians skilled to play, And dancing-girls in bright array Stand ready in the second ring Within the palace of the king. Each honoured tree, each holy shrine With leaves and flowery wreaths entwine, And here and there beneath the shade Be food prepared and presents laid. Then brightly clad, in warlike guise, With long swords girt upon their thighs, Let soldiers of the nobler sort March to the monarch's splendid court.” Thus gave command the twice-born pair To active servants stationed there. Then hastened to the king and said That all their task was duly sped, The king to wise Sumantra spake: “Now quick, my lord, thy chariot take, And hither with thy swiftest speed

### Verse 11 (Ramayan 0.331)
- **Original**: Canto III. Dasaratha's Precepts. 313 My son, my noble Ráma lead.” Sumantra, ere the word was given, His chariot from the court had driven, And Ráma, best of all who ride In cars, came sitting by his side. The lords of men had hastened forth From east and west and south and north, Áryan and stranger, those who dwell In the wild wood and on the fell, And as the Gods to Indra, they Showed honour to the king that day. Like Vásav, when his glorious form Is circled by the Gods of storm, Girt in his hall by kings he saw His car-borne Ráma near him draw, Like him who rules the minstrel band Of heaven;262 whose valour filled the land, Of mighty arm and stately pride Like a wild elephant in stride, As fair in face as that fair stone Dear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,263 With noble gifts and grace that took The hearts of all, and chained each look, World-cheering as the Lord of Rain When floods relieve the parching plain. The father, as the son came nigh, Gazed with an ever-thirstier eye. Sumantra helped the prince alight From the good chariot passing bright, 262 Chitraratha, King of the Gandharvas. 263 The Chandrakánta or Moonstone, a sort of crystal supposed to be composed of congealed moonbeams.

Then Ráma clomb, the king to seek That terrace like Kailása's peak, And reached the presence of the king, Sumantra closely following. Before his father's face he came, Raised suppliant hands and named his name,264 And bowing lowly as is meet Paid reverence to the monarch's feet. But soon as Da[aratha viewed The prince in humble attitude, He raised him by the hand in haste And his beloved son embraced, Then signed him to a glorious throne, Gem-decked and golden, near his own. Then Ráma, best of Raghu's line, Made the fair seat with lustre shine As when the orient sun upsprings And his pure beam on Meru flings. The glory flashed on roof and wall, And with strange sheen suffused the hall, As when the moon's pure rays are sent Through autumn's star-lit firmament. Then swelled his breast with joy and pride As his dear son the father eyed, E'en as himself more fair arrayed In some clear mirror's face displayed. The aged monarch gazed awhile, Then thus addressed him with a smile, As Ka[yap, whom the worlds revere, Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear: 264 A customary mark of respect to a superior.

I know that thou by nature's bent Both modest art and excellent, But though thy gifts no counsel need My love suggests the friendly rede. Mine own dear son, be modest still, And rule each sense with earnest will. Keep thou the evils far away That spring from love and anger's sway. Thy noble course alike pursue In secret as in open view, And every nerve, the love to gain Of ministers and subjects, strain. The happy prince who sees with pride His thriving people satisfied; Whose arsenals with arms are stored, And treasury with golden hoard,— [093] His friends rejoice as joyed the Blest When Amrit crowned their eager quest. So well, my child, thy course maintain, And from all ill thy soul refrain.” The friends of Ráma, gathered nigh, Longing their lord to gratify, Ran to Kau[alyá's bower to tell The tidings that would please her well. She, host of dames, with many a gem,

Then Ráma paid the reverence due, Mounted the chariot, and withdrew, And to his splendid dwelling drove While crowds to show him honour strove. The people, when the monarch's speech Their willing ears had heard, Were wild with joy as though on each Great gifts had been conferred. With meek and low salute each man Turned to his home away, And there with happy heart began To all the Gods to pray. Canto IV. Ráma Summoned. The crowd dismissed, to high debate The monarch called his peers of state, And, counsel from their lips obtained, Firm in his will his will explained: “To-morrow with auspicious ray The moon in Pushya's sign will stay; Be that the time with happy fate Mine eldest son to consecrate, And let my Ráma, lotus-eyed, As Regent o'er the state preside.”

His coming, told to Ráma's ear, Suggested anxious doubt and fear. He bade the messenger be led That instant in, and thus he said: “Tell me the cause, omitting naught, Why thou again my house hast sought.” The envoy answered:“Prince, thy sire Has sent thy presence to require. My sender known, 'tis thine to say If thou wilt go or answer nay.” Then Ráma, when he heard his speech, Made haste the royal court to reach. Soon as the monarch was aware His dearest son was waiting there, Eager the parley to begin He bade them lead the prince within, Soon as he passed the chamber door The hero bent him to the floor, And at a distance from his seat Raised his joined hands his sire to greet. The monarch raised him from the ground, And loving arms about him wound, Then pointed to a seat that shone With gold for him to rest upon. “Aged am I,” he said,“and worn; In life's best joys my share have borne; Rites to the Gods, in hundreds, paid, With gifts of corn and largess made. I yearned for sons: my life is blest

- **Original**: 318 The Ramayana With them and thee of sons the best. No debt to saints or Bráhmans, no, Nor spirits, Gods, or self I owe. One duty now remains alone, To set thee on thy father's throne. Now therefore, Ráma, hear my rede, And mark my words with duteous heed: This day the peoples' general voice, Elects thee king of love and choice, And I, consenting to the prayer, Will make thee, darling, Regent Heir. Dread visions, each returning night, With evil omens scare my sight. Red meteors with a fearful sound Shoot wildly downward to the ground, While tempests lash the troubled air; And they who read the stars declare That, leagued against my natal sign, Ráhu,265 the Sun,266 and Mars combine. When portents dire as these appear, A monarch's death or woe is near. Then while my senses yet are spared, And thought and will are unimpaired, Be thou, my son, anointed king: Men's fancy is a fickle thing. To-day the moon, in order due, Entered the sign Punarvasu,267 To-morrow, as the wise foretell, 265 Ráhu, the ascending node, is in mythology a demon with the tail of a dragon whose head was severed from his body by VishGu, but being immortal, the head and tail retained their separate existence and being transferred to the stellar sphere became the authors of eclipses; the first especially by endeavouring to swallow the sun and moon. 266 In eclipse. 267 The seventh of the lunar asterisms.

My soul, prophetic, counsels haste: Thee, O my son, to-morrow I As Regent Heir will sanctify. So till the coming night be passed Do thou and Sítá strictly fast: From worldly thoughts thy soul refrain, And couched on holy grass remain. [094] And let thy trusted lords attend In careful watch upon their friend, For, unexpected, check and bar Our weightiest counsels often mar. While Bharat too is far away Making with royal kin his stay, I deem the fittest time of all Thee, chosen Regent, to install. It may be Bharat still has stood True to the counsels of the good, Faithful to thee with tender trust, With governed senses, pure and just. But human minds, too well I know, Will sudden changes undergo, And by their constant deeds alone The virtue of the good is shown. Now, Ráma, go. My son, good night! Fixt is to-morrow for the rite.” Then Ráma paid the reverence due, And quickly to his home withdrew. He passed within, nor lingered there, But sought his mother's mansion, where The dame in linen robes arrayed Devoutly in the chapel prayed

There was Sumitrá too, and there Was Lakshma G led by loving care: And when the royal choice they knew Sítá in haste was summoned too. Absorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queen Attended by the three was seen. She knew that Pushya's lucky hour Would raise her son to royal power, So fixed with bated breath each thought On God supreme, by all men sought. To her, as thus she knelt and prayed, Ráma drew near, due reverence paid, And then to swell his mother's joy, Thus spoke her own beloved boy; “O mother dear, my sire's decree Entrusts the people's weal to me. To-morrow I, for so his will, Anointed king, the throne shall fill. The few last hours till night shall end Sítá with me must fasting spend, For so my father has decreed, And holy priests with him agreed. What vows soever thou mayst deem My consecration's eve beseem, Do thou, sweet mother, for my sake And for beloved Sítá's make.” When the glad news Kau[alyá heard, So long desired, so long deferred, While tears of joy her utterance broke, In answer to her son she spoke: “Long be thy life, my darling: now

Surely the stars were wondrous fair When thee, sweet son, thy mother bare, That thy good gifts such love inspire And win the favour of thy sire. With thee I travailed not in vain; Those lotus eyes reward my pain, And all the glory of the line Of old Ikshváku will be thine.” He smiled, and on his brother gazed Who sate with reverent hands upraised, And said:“My brother, thou must be Joint-ruler of this land with me. My second self thou, LakshmaG, art, And in my fortune bearest part. Be thine, Sumitrá's son, to know The joys from regal power that flow. My life itself, the monarch's seat, For thy dear sake to me are sweet.” Thus Ráma to his brother said, To both his mothers268 bowed his head, And then with Sítá by his side To his own house the hero hied. 268 Kau [alyá and Sumitrá.

Straight to Prince Ráma's high abode, That like a cloud pale-tinted showed, Borne in his priestly car he rode. Two courts he passed, and in the third He stayed his car. Then Ráma heard The holy sage was come, and flew To honour him with honour due. He hastened to the car and lent His hand to aid the priest's descent. Then spoke Va[ishmha words like these, Pleased with his reverent courtesies, With pleasant things his heart to cheer Who best deserved glad news to hear: “Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace, And thine will be the Regent's place: Now with thy Sítá, as is right, In strictest fasting spend the night,[095]
