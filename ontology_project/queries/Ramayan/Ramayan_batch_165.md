## Verses to Analyze

### Verse 1 (Ramayana 0.1326)
- **Original**: 1308 The Ramayana To warn them of their lord's intent. Let others urged by thee repeat My mandate that their steps be fleet. Those lords who yielding to the sway Of love's delight would fain delay, Urge hither with the utmost speed, Or with thee to my presence lead: And those who linger to the last Until ten days be come and passed, And dare their sovereign to defy, For their offence shall surely die. Thousands, yea millions, shall there be, Obedient to their king's decree, The lions of the Vánar race, Assembled from each distant place, Forth shall they haste like hills in size, Or mighty clouds that veil the skies, And swiftly speeding on their way Bring all our legions in array.”[369] He ceased: the son of Váyu645 heard, Submissive to his sovereign's word; And sent his rapid envoys forth To east and west and south and north. They bent their airy course afar Along the paths of bird and star, And sped through ether farther yet Where VishGu's splendid sphere is set.646 By sea, on hill, by wood and lake They called to arms for Ráma's sake, As each with terror in his breast Obeyed his awful king's behest. 645 Váyu or the Wind was the father of Hanumán. 646 The path or station of VishGu is the space between the seven Rishis or Ursa Major, and Dhruva or the polar star.

### Verse 2 (Ramayana 0.1327)
- **Original**: Canto XXXVII. The Gathering. 1309 Three million Vánars, fierce and strong As Anjan's self, a wondrous throng Sped from the spot where Ráma still Gazed restless from the woody hill. Ten million others, brave and bold, With coats that shone like burning gold, Came flying from the mountain crest Where sinks the weary sun to rest. Impetuous from the northern skies, Where Mount Kailása's summits rise, Ten hundred millions hasted, hued Like manes of lions, ne'er subdued: The dwellers on Himálaya's side, Whose food his roots and fruit supplied, With rangers of the Vindhyan chain And neighbours of the Milky Main.647 Some from the palm groves where they fed, Some from the woods of betel sped: In countless numbers, fierce and brave, They came from mountain, lake, and cave. As on their way the Vánars went To rouse each distant armament, They chanced that wondrous tree to view That on Himálaya's summit grew. Of old upon that sacred height Was wrought Mahe[var's648 glorious rite, Which every God in heaven beheld, And his glad heart with triumph swelled. There from pure seed at random sown Bright plants with luscious fruit had grown, 647 One of the seven seas which surround the earth in concentric circles. 648 The title of Mahe[var or Mighty Lord is sometimes given to Indra, but more generally toZiva whom it here denotes.

- **Original**: 1310 The Ramayana And, sweet as Amrit to the taste, The summit of the mountain graced. Who once should eat the virtuous fruit That sprang from so divine a root, One whole revolving moon should be From every pang of hunger free. The Vánars culled the fruit they found Ripe on the sacrificial ground With rare celestial odours sweet, To lay them at Sugríva's feet. Those noble envoys scoured the land To summon every Vánar band Then swiftly homeward at the head Of countless armaments they sped. They gathered by Kishkindhá's wall. They thronged Sugríva's palace hall, And, richly laden, bare within That fruit of heavenly origin. Their gifts before their king they spread, And thus in tones of triumph said: “Through every land our way we took To visit hill and wood and brook, And all thy hosts from east to west Flock hither at their lord's behest.” Sugríva with delighted look The present of his envoys took, Then bade them go, with gracious speech Rewarding and dismissing each.

Sugríva deemed already done The work he planned for Raghu's son. Then LakshmaG gently spoke and cheered Sugríva for his valour feared: “Now, chieftain, if thy will be so, Forth from Kishkindhá let us go.” Sugríva's heart swelled high with pride As to the prince he thus replied: “Come, speed we forth without delay: 'Tis mine thy mandate to obey.” Sugríva bade the dames adieu, And Tárá and the rest withdrew. Then at their chieftain's summons came The Vánars first in rank and fame, A trusty brave and reverent band, Meet e'en before a queen to stand. They at his call made haste to bring The litter of the glorious king. “Mount, O my friend.” Sugríva cried, And straight Sumitrá's son complied. Then took by LakshmaG's side his place The sovereign of the woodland race, Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong, Who bore the glittering load along. On high above his royal head A paly canopy was spread, And chouries white in many a hand The forehead of the monarch fanned, And shell and drum and song and shout Pealed round him as the king passed out.

### Verse 5 (Ramayana 0.1330)
- **Original**: 1312 The Ramayana About the monarch went a throng Of Vánar warriors brave and strong, As onward to the mountain shade Where Ráma dwelt his way he made. Soon as the lovely spot he viewed Where Ráma lived in solitude, The Vánar monarch, far-renowed, With LakshmaG, lightly stepped to ground, And to the son of Raghu went Joining his raised hands reverent. As their great leader raised his hands, So suppliant stood the Vánar bands. Well pleased the son of Raghu saw Those legions, hushed in reverent awe, Stand silent like the tranquil floods That raise their hands of lotus buds. But Ráma, when the king, to greet His friend, had bowed him at his feet, Raised him who ruled the Vánar race, And held him in a close embrace: Then, when his arms he had unknit, Besought him by his side to sit, And thus with gentle words the best Of men the Vánar king addressed: “The prince who well his days divides, And knows aright the times and tides To follow duty, joy, or gain, He, only he, deserves to reign. But he who wealth and virtue leaves, And every hour to pleasure cleaves, Falls from his bliss like him who wakes From slumber on a branch that breaks. True king is he who smites his foes,

The hour is come that bids thee rise To aid me in my enterprise. Then call thy nobles to debate, And with their help deliberate.” “Lost was my power,” the king replied, “All strength had fled, all hope had died. The Vánars owned another lord, But by thy grace was all restored. All this, O conqueror of the foe, To thee and LakshmaG's aid I owe. And his should be the villain's shame Who durst deny the sacred claim. These Vánar chiefs of noblest birth Have at my bidding roamed the earth, And brought from distant regions all Our legions at their monarch's call: Fierce bears with monkey troops combined, And apes of every varied kind, Terrific in their forms, who dwell In grove and wood and bosky dell: The bright Gandharvas' brood, the seed Of Gods,649 they change their shapes at need. Each with his legions in array, Hither, O Prince, they make their way. They come: and tens of millions swell To numbers that no tongue may tell.650 For thee their armies will unite 649 See Book I, Canto XVI. 650 The numbers are unmanageable in English verse. The poet speaks of hundreds ofarbudas; and anarbuda is a hundred millions.

These round thee to the war will go, To smite to earth thy demon foe; Will slay the Rákshas and restore Thy consort when the fight is o'er.” Canto XXXIX. The Vánar Host. Then Ráma, best of all who guide Their steps by duty, thus replied: “What marvel if Lord Indra send The kindly rain, O faithful friend? If, thousand-rayed, the God of Day Drive every darksome cloud away? Or, rising high, the Lord of Night Flood the broad heaven with silver light? What marvel, King, that one like thee The glory of his friends should be? No marvel, O my lord, that thou Hast shown thy noble nature now. Thy heart, Sugríva, well I know: Naught from thy lips but truth may flow, With thee for friend and champion all My foes beneath my arm will fall. The Rákshas, when my queen he stole, Brought sure destruction on his soul,

Yes, near, Sugríva, is the day When I my demon foe shall slay, As conquering Indra in his ire Slew Queen Paulomí's haughty sire.”652 [371] He ceased: thick clouds of dust rose high To every quarter of the sky: The very sun grew faint and pale Behind the darkly-gathering veil. The mighty clouds that hung o'erhead From east to west thick darkness spread, And earth to her foundations shook With hill and forest, lake and brook. Then hidden was the ground beneath Fierce warriors armed with fearful teeth, Hosts numberless, each lord in size A match for him who rules the skies: From many a sea and distant hill, From rock and river, lake and rill. Some like the morning sun were bright, Some, like the moon, were silver white: These green as lotus fibres, those White-coated from their native snows.653 651 Anuhláda or Anuhráda is one of the four sons of the mighty HiraGyaka[ipu, an Asur or a Daitya son of Ka[yapa and Diti and killed by VishGu in his incarnation of the Man-LionNarasinha. According to the Bhágavata PuráGa the Daitya or Asur HiraGyaka[ipu and HiraGyáksha his brother, both killed by VishGu, were born again as RávaG and KumbhakarGa his brother. 652 Puloma, a demon, was the father-in-law of Indra who destroyed him in order to avert an imprecation. Paulomí is a patronymic denotingZachí the daughter of Puloma. 653 “Observe the variety of colours which the poem attributes to all these inhabitants of the different mountainous regions, some white, others yellow, &c. Such different colours were perhaps peculiar and distinctive characteristics of those various races.” G ORRESSIO {FNS .

There Panas, first for warlike fame, With twenty million warriors came. There glorious Níla, dark of hue, Arrayed his countless troops in view. There moved lord Gavaya brave and bold, Resplendent like a hill of gold, And near him Darímukha stood With millions from the hill and wood And Dwivid famed for strength and speed, And Mamda, both of A[vin seed. There Gaja, strong and glorious, led The countless troops around him spread, 654 SusheG. 655 Tára. 656 Kesarí was the husband of Hanúmán's mother, and is here called his father.

They covered all the plain, and still Pressed forward over wood and hill. In rows for many a league around They rested on the grassy ground; Or to Sugríva made their way, Like clouds about the Lord of Day, And to the king their proud heads bent In power and might preeminent. Sugríva then to Ráma sped, And raised his reverent hands, and said That every chief from coast to coast Was present with his warrior host. 657 “I here unite under one heading two animals of very diverse nature and race, but which from some gross resemblances, probably helped by an equivoque in the language, are closely affiliated in the Hindoo myth… a reddish colour of the skin, want of symmetry and ungainliness of form, strength in hugging with the fore paws or arms, the faculty of climbing, shortness of tail(?), sen- suality, capacity of instruction in dancing and in music, are all characteristics which more or less distinguish and meet in bears as well as in monkeys. In theRámáya Gam , the wise Jámnavant, the Odysseus of the expedition of Lanká, is called now king of the bears (rikshaparthivah), now great monkey (Mahákapih).” D E G UBERNATIS {FNS :Zoological Mythology, Vol. II. p. 97. 658 Gandhamádana, Angad, Tára, Indrajánu, Rambha, Durmukha, Hanumán, Nala, Da mukha,Zarabha, Kumuda, Vahni.

Chiefs strong as Indra's self, who speed Wher'er they list, these armies lead. Fierce and terrific to the view As Daityas or the Dánav659 crew,[372] Famed in all lands for souls afire With lofty thoughts, they never tire, O'er hill and vale they wander free, And islets of the distant sea. And these gathered myriads, all Will serve thee, Ráma, at thy call. Whate'er thy heart advises, say: Thy mandates will the host obey.” Then answered Ráma, as he pressed The Vánar monarch to his breast: “O search for my lost Sítá, strive To find her if she still survive: And in thy wondrous wisdom trace Fierce RávaG to his dwelling-place. And when by toil and search we know Where Sítá lies and where the foe, With thee, dear friend, will I devise Fit means to end the enterprise. 659 Daityas and Dánavas are fiends and enemies of the Gods, like the Titans of Greek mythology.

There seek for Sítá, trace the spot Where RávaG hides, and weary not. Search for the captive in the caves Of mountains, and by woods and waves.

Search where the torrent floods that rend The mountain to the plains descend: Search dark abysses where they rave, Search mountain slope and wood and cave Then on with rapid feet and gain The inlands of the fearful main Where, tortured by the tempest's lash, Against rude rocks the billows dash: An ocean like a sable cloud, Whose margent monstrous serpents crowd: [373] An ocean rising with a roar To beat upon an iron shore. On, onward still! your feet shall tread Shores of the sea whose waves are red, Where spreading wide your eyes shall see The guilt-tormenting cotton tree674 And the wild spot where Garu 675 dwells Which gems adorn and ocean shells, High as Kailása, nobly decked, Wrought by the heavenly architect.676 673 This appears to be some mythical stream and not the well-knownZone. The name means red-coloured. 674 A fabulous thorny rod of the cotton tree used for torturing the wicked in hell.

Speed onward still: your steps shall be At length beside the Milky Sea Whose every ripple as it curls Gleams glorious with its wealth of pearls. Amid that sea like pale clouds spread The white Mount Rishabh678 rears his head. About the mountain's glorious waist Woods redolent of bloom are braced. A lake where lotuses unfold Their silver buds with threads of gold, Sudar[an ever bright and fair Where white swans sport, lies gleaming there, The wandering Kinnar's679 dear resort, Where heavenly nymphs and Yakshas680 sport. On! leave the Milky Sea behind: Another flood your search shall find, A waste of waters, wild and drear, That chills each living heart with fear. There see the horse's awful head, 677 “The terrific fiends named Mandehas attempt to devour the sun: for Brahmá denounced this curse upon them, that without the power to perish they should die every day (and revive by night) and therefore a fierce contest occurs (daily) between them and the sun.” W ILSON 'S{FNS VishGu PuráGa.

A triple-headed palm of gold— Meet standard for the lofty-souled— Springs towering from the mountain's crest Beneath whose shade he loves to rest, So that in eastern realms each God May use it as a measuring-rod. Beyond, with burning gold aglow, The eastern steep his peaks will show, Which in unrivalled glory rise A hundred leagues to pierce the skies, 681 Aurva was one of the descendants of Bhrigu. From his wrath proceeded a flame that threatened to destroy the world, had not Aurva cast it into the ocean where it remained concealed, and having the face of a horse.

Search every nook and bosky dell, If RávaG there with Sítá dwell. There, Vánars, there your steps must stay: No farther eastward can ye stray. Beyond no sun, no moon gives light, But all is sunk in endless night. Thus far, O Vánar lords, may you O'er sea and land your search pursue. But wild and dark and known to none Is the drear space beyond the sun.
